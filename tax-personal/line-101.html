  <p>Employment income can consist of amounts you receive as salary, wages, commissions (see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-102-commissions-box-42.html">line 102</a>), bonuses, tips, gratuities, and honoraria. Employment income is usually shown in <strong class="nowrap">box 14</strong> of your <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/understand-your-tax-slips/t4-slips/t4-statement-remuneration-paid.html">T4 slips</a>.</p>

  </ul>
  <p>If you have not received your T4 slip by early April or if you have any questions about an amount on a slip, contact your employer.</p>
  <p>If you have employment expenses, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-229-other-employment-expenses.html">line&nbsp;229</a>.</p>
  <p>If you received a housing allowance and/or an amount for eligible utilities as a member of the clergy and they are shown in box 14 of your T4 slips, subtract the amount shown in box 30 of your T4 slips from the amount shown in box 14 and report the difference on line 101. Report the amount shown in box 30 of your T4 slips on <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-104-other-employment-income/line-104-clergy-s-housing-allowance-amount-eligible-utilities.html">line 104</a>.</p>
  <p>If you have employment income from another country, report it on <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-104-other-employment-income/line-104-foreign-employment-income.html">line&nbsp;104</a>.</p>
  <p>You may be able to make Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions on certain employment income for which no contribution was made (for example, tips not shown on a T4 slip or&nbsp;extra contributions on T4 income if you had more than one employer in the year).

    You may have received a payment from an eligible employer, such as a government, a municipality, or another public authority for your work as a volunteer ambulance technician, a volunteer firefighter, a search and rescue volunteer, or other type of emergency worker. The <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t4.html">T4 slips</a> issued by this authority will generally show only the taxable part of the payment in box 14 of your T4 slip, which is the part that is more than $1,000.<br>
  </p>
  <p>The exempt part of a payment is shown in box 87 of your T4 slips. If you provided volunteer emergency services for more than one employer, you can claim the $1,000 exemption for <strong>each</strong> of your eligible employers.</p>

      <p>As an emergency services volunteer, you may qualify to claim the $3,000 volunteer firefighters’ amount (VFA) or the search and rescue volunteers’ amount (SRVA). See <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-g/general-income-tax-benefit-guide-federal-tax-credits-schedule-1.html#Line362">lines 362</a> and <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-g/general-income-tax-benefit-guide-federal-tax-credits-schedule-1.html#Line395">395</a>.<br>
      </p>
      <p>If you are eligible for the $1,000 exemption on line 101 of your return and either the VFA or the SRVA (lines 362 and 395 of your <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-s1.html">Schedule 1</a>), you must choose which one you would like to claim.<br>
        <br>
        If you choose to claim the $1,000 exemption, report only the amounts shown in box 14 of your <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t4.html">T4 slips</a> on line 101 of your return, and do not claim an amount on lines 362 and 395 of your Schedule 1.<br>
        <br>
        If the authority employed you (other than as a volunteer) for the same or similar duties or if you choose to claim the VFA or the SRVA, the full payment is taxable. Add the amounts shown in boxes 87 and 14 of your T4 slips, and report the result on line 101 of your return.</p>

  <p>Report taxable benefits you received in (or carried forward to) 2018 on certain security options you exercised. For more information, see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4037.html">Guide T4037, Capital Gains</a>.</p>
  <h4><a id="WageLossReplacementPlanIncome"></a>Wage-loss replacement plan income</h4>
  <p>If you received payments from a wage-loss replacement plan shown in box 14 of your <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t4.html">T4 slips</a>, you may not have to report the full amount on your return. Report the amount you received minus the contributions you made to the plan if you did not use them on a previous year’s return. Report on <strong>line 103</strong> of your return your total contributions to your wage-loss replacement plan shown in the supporting documents from your employer or insurance company.

  <p>If you received a housing allowance or an amount for eligible utilities as a member of the clergy and they are shown in box 14 of your <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t4.html">T4 slips</a>, report the amount shown in box 30 of your T4 slips on line 104 of your return. Subtract the amount shown in box 30 of your T4 slips from the amount shown in box 14, and report the difference on line 101 of your return.</p>
