                <h2 id="h-1">Prepare follow up documentation</h2>
                <p>You should also be prepared to provide the CRA with other documentation we may request during our remission review. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>If you are making a remission request based on your financial circumstances, the CRA may ask you for full financial disclosure. This may include a complete statement of your income and expenses and assets and liabilities. To see the type of financial information the CRA may request, review <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc376.html">Form RC376 Taxpayer Relief Request - Statement of Income and Expenses and Assets and Liabilities for Individuals)</a>.</li>
                  <li>If relevant to your request, the CRA may ask for copies of contracts, separation agreements, wills (where the request relates to an estate), registered charity documents, corporate records, or other types of documents or substantiation.</li>
                </ul>
              </section>

              <section>
                <h2 id="h-2">How we review your request</h2>
                <p>Each remission request is reviewed based on the broad terms set out in section 23 of the FAA in order to determine whether collection of the tax or other debt or enforcement of the interest or penalty is unreasonable or unjust, or if remission is otherwise in the public interest.</p>
                <p>The CRA screens each remission request to determine if it should be reviewed further. If the basis of a remission request does not demonstrate that further review is required to determine whether the collection of a tax or other debt or enforcement of interest or penalty is unreasonable or unjust, or that remission is otherwise in the public interest, the requestor will be advised.</p>
                <p>If the CRA determines that a request may qualify for remission, it may be submitted to the Governor in Council (GIC) which has this authority to  grant a remission order under section 23 of the <a href="http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/index.html">Financial Administration Act (FAA)</a>.</p>
              </section>

              <section>
                <h2 id="h-3">When you can expect a decision</h2>
                <p>The CRA’s goal is to advise taxpayers, within 30 days of screening their file, whether their request will be accepted into inventory for an in-depth review. In some cases – such as those mentioned in What scenarios are generally unlikely to qualify for remission? – the request will not be accepted into inventory and the requestor will be advised of that decision.</p>
                <p>If a taxpayer’s request will undergo an in-depth review, they will be advised within 30 days that their file will be placed in inventory. All files accepted into inventory are reviewed on a first-in, first-out basis. Each request is unique and, given the extraordinary nature of remission, the CRA’s review process is necessarily thorough. As such, there is no set timeframe for completing an in-depth review of a file. However, the CRA always strives to complete its review in a timely manner. Once a decision has been made following an in-depth review, the taxpayer will be advised of that decision.</p>
              </section>

              <section>
                <h2 id="h-4">Receive a credit or refund if granted</h2>
                <p>If remission is granted, a credit in the specified amount will be applied to the taxpayer’s account. If the application of the remission order results in a refund, that refund may first be applied to any amount the taxpayer currently owes or is about to owe. A remission order does not result in the reassessment of a taxpayer’s return.</p>
                <p>The federal government is precluded from paying credit interest on amounts forgiven by means of a remission order as there is no statutory provision for such payments under the FAA.</p>
                <p>All remission orders are published in Part II of the Canada Gazette. A remission order typically includes the taxpayer's name, the amount remitted, the applicable tax years or reporting periods, and a brief explanation of the basis for remission.</p>
              </section>

              <section>
                <h2 id="h-5">What recourse is available if denied</h2>
                <p>If the CRA has determined that a taxpayer’s facts and circumstances cannot support remission, there is no formal right of appeal. However, a taxpayer may apply for a judicial review of the decision by the Federal Court of Canada within 30 days after the decision is communicated. If the Court determines that the CRA did not properly exercise discretion, it will not overturn the CRA’s decision. It can only refer the matter back to the CRA for another review. Information on the judicial review process and application procedures are found on the Federal Court website.</p>
