                <h2 id="h-1">We may ask you for additional information</h2>
                <p>You should be prepared to provide other documents we may request during our review. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>If you are making a request based on your financial circumstances, we may ask you for full financial disclosure. This may include a complete statement of your income and expenses and assets and liabilities. To see the type of financial information we may request, review <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc376.html">Form RC376 Taxpayer Relief Request - Statement of Income and Expenses and Assets and Liabilities for Individuals)</a>.</li>
                  <li>If relevant to your request, we may ask for copies of contracts, separation agreements, wills (where the request relates to an estate), registered charity documents, corporate records, or other types of documents.</li>
                </ul>
              </section>

              <section>
                <h2 id="h-2">How we review your request</h2>
                <p>Remission requests are reviewed based on the broad terms set out in section 23 of the <a href="http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/index.html">Financial Administration Act (FAA)</a>. Consistent with these terms, we will assess whether collection of the tax or other debt or enforcement of the interest or penalty is unreasonable or unjust, or if remission is otherwise in the public interest. Broad concerns must be considered in assessing whether it is in the public interest to recommend the extraordinary remedy of remission, including: maintaining the integrity of the statutory appeals process, the self-assessing nature of Canada’s tax system, your responsibility to understand and meet your tax obligations, and fairness to other Canadians experiencing serious health and personal problems.</p>
                <p>We also review requests against our remission guidelines, which are based on characteristics common to past cases where remission has been granted. The guidelines set out categories where remission may be supported, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Extreme financial hardship</li>
                  <li>Financial setback with an extenuating factor</li>
                  <li>Mistakes made by the CRA, and</li>
                  <li>Unintended results of the legislation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The guidelines are not exhaustive and do not limit what circumstances may be considered. Each request for remission is considered on its own merits, based on the facts and circumstances specific to the request.</p>
                <p>When reviewing a request, we consider all relevant facts and circumstances and will seek out additional information and documentation as needed (for example, notes, correspondence, and reports stored in our systems that contain information about a taxpayer’s compliance history, past communication with the CRA, current or past employers, assets, income amounts and other financial information, information found in court decisions or from third parties, credit reports, property and internet searches, or other relevant substantiation).</p>
              </section>

              <section>
                <h2 id="h-3">When you can expect a decision</h2>
                <p>We aim to inform you within 30 calendar days of screening your request whether we will review your request further. If the basis of a remission request does not demonstrate that further review is required to determine whether the collection of a tax or other debt or enforcement of interest or penalty is unreasonable or unjust, or that remission is otherwise in the public interest, the requestor will be advised in writing.</p>
                <p>All requests accepted for review, are processed on a first-in, first-out basis. Given the extraordinary nature of remission, our review process is thorough. There is no set timeframe for completing a remission review.</p>
                <p>If we determine that remission could be supported, the request will be sent to the GIC for a decision. The GIC can grant a remission order under section 23 of the <a href="http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/index.html">Financial Administration Act (FAA)</a>.</p>
                <p>We will publish remission orders in Part II of the Canada Gazette. A remission order includes the taxpayer&#39;s name, the amount remitted, the tax years or reporting periods, and a brief explanation of the basis for remission.</p>
              </section>

              <section>
                <h2 id="h-4">Receive a credit or refund if granted</h2>
                <p>If remission is granted, a credit in the specified amount will be applied to the taxpayer’s account. If the remission order results in a refund that refund will first cover other amounts you owe or are about to owe. A remission order does not result in the reassessment of your tax return.</p>
                <p>We cannot pay refund interest on amounts forgiven by a remission order. The FAA does not provide a legal provision for such payments.</p>
              </section>

              <section>
                <h2 id="h-5">What recourse is available if denied</h2>
                <p>If we determine that your facts and circumstances cannot support remission, there is no formal right of appeal. However, you may apply for a judicial review of the decision by the Federal Court of Canada within 30 days after the decision is communicated. If the Court determines that we did not properly exercise discretion, it won’t overturn our decision. It can only refer the matter back to us for another review.</p>
