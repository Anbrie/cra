                <h2 id="h-1">Remission is only considered in exceptional circumstances</h2>
                <p>A remission order is a rare and extraordinary measure.</p>
                <p>Remission provides full or partial relief from tax, interest, penalty, or other debt where this relief is warranted but cannot be achieved under applicable tax laws, through an assessment, or through other actions.</p>
                <p>Remission is highly discretionary. The CRA will examine each request to determine if a remission review is appropriate. Not all requests are accepted for review. If a request is accepted by the CRA, it is subject to an in-depth review process.</p>
                <p>Very few requests result in remission being granted.</p>
              </section>

              <section>
                <h2 id="h-2">Situations unlikely to be accepted for review</h2>
                <p>Remission is generally not recommended if:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>circumstances affect the population as a whole, for example a downturn in the economy</li>
                  <li>the appropriate recourse belongs with a third party and not the CRA:
                    <ul>
                      <li>you entered into an arrangement with a third party that turned out to be fraudulent</li>
                      <li>you engage the services of a tax professional who makes an error or omission</li>
                      <li>you entered into a business arrangement with negative tax consequences, with a third party who misled you</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>you were non-compliant, such as:
                    <ul>
                      <li>you missed deadlines as a result of a chronic history of non-compliance with filing and remitting obligations</li>
                      <li>you intentionally avoided or evaded tax obligations or payment of a tax debt</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>the remission request is an attempt to re-visit an audit, objection, consent to judgment or court decision because you were dissatisfied with the results</li>
                  <li>you did not request or change a tax return, a reassessment, an election, a Notice of Objection, or further appeal a matter to court within the time limits, and you are attempting to use remission to extend those time limits</li>
                  <li>granting remission, including the cumulative effect of a number of remissions, would be harmful to public finances or would compromise the integrity of tax or benefit administration</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Even if the circumstances above are present, there may be other valid reasons that would justify reviewing the request.</p>

                <h2 id="h-3">Situations that may be accepted for review</h2>
                <p>The CRA has developed guidelines based on characteristics common in cases where remission has been granted. These guidelines assist the CRA in determining whether to accept a request for review.</p>
                <p>Your request could still be accepted for review even if your situation is not listed here.</p>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li>
                    <details>
                      <summary>Extreme financial hardship</summary>
                      <p>Remission is generally only recommended under this guideline if you are in such severe hardship that your current and anticipated finances are not adequate to resolve your debt.</p>
                      <p>We will generally only consider remission if you are experiencing hardship at the time you make the request. We will also examine your ability to pay the debt throughout the period under review. Your request is more likely to be accepted if you experienced hardship since the debt arose.</p>
                      <p>When considering the severity of hardship, we review:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>the impact paying the amount owing would have on you</li>
                        <li>your age, health, available resources, and income levels</li>
                        <li>your annual family income , since your debt arose, compared to low income cut-offs for your region
                          <ul>
                            <li>your annual family income includes the total income earned by you and your spouse, as well as any other adults that reside at your residence</li>
                            <li><a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110024101">Find out more about Statistics Canada’s low income cut-offs for each geographical area</a></li>

                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <h3>Corporations and trusts rarely qualify for extreme hardship</h3>
                      <p>Extreme financial hardship means that you cannot afford the basic necessities of life, such as food, shelter and clothing. Therefore:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>corporations are unlikely to qualify for remission based on extreme financial hardship, unless it can be shown that the corporation’s financial difficulties would force it to stop operating and adversely affect a large group or community</li>
                        <li>trusts and estates are unlikely to qualify for remission based on extreme financial hardship as the concept of affording the basic necessities of life does not apply to them</li>
                      </ul>
                    </details>
                  </li>

                    <details>
                      <summary>Financial setback with an extenuating factor</summary>
                      <p>Financial setback is less severe than extreme financial hardship.</p>
                      <p>We may accept your request for review if:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>payment of your debt would strain your limited finances, and</li>
                        <li>you have an extenuating factor beyond your control that clearly relates to your debt</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>An extenuating factor might be a serious illness that makes you unable to meet your tax or filing obligations. In such a case, you will need to submit medical reports and an explanation of how the illness led to your debt, along with evidence of your inability to pay.</p>
                    </details>

                      <summary>Mistakes made by the CRA</summary>
                      <p>Incorrect actions taken by or instructions provided by a CRA official that results in additional tax may be eligible for a remission review. You need evidence to qualify. The presence of an error alone would not generally be enough.</p>
                      <p>We will also consider whether:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>there is evidence of bad faith on your part</li>
                        <li>you could have done something to avoid or minimize the tax
                          <ul>
                            <li>for GST/HST, you could have collected or remitted the tax, or claimed a rebate</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>you made your request for remission within a time period that enabled CRA officials to properly investigate the matter</li>
                        <li>there is verifiable evidence that CRA officials acted incorrectly or gave you incorrect instructions
                          <ul>
                            <li>in cases where there is no evidence, we may be able to verify the facts by other acceptable and credible means</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>you could not have filed a waiver or Notice of Objection or sent new information within the required time limits to resolve the problem by other means
                          <ul>
                            <li>for example, by sending more representations during an audit or objection</li>
                          </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>the error would have been recognized as an error at the time of the assessment and not based on subsequent events</li>
                        <li>actions taken by or instructions provided by CRA officials may have misled or discouraged you from taking timely or appropriate action</li>
                        <li>any instructions given were incorrect at that time and you acted on the basis of those instructions</li>
                        <li>you had reason to believe that the CRA official was acting in an authorized capacity</li>
                        <li>another course of action was available to you that would have significantly reduced your tax debt (within the applicable legislation)</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>We will consider your specific circumstances to determine whether you’ve taken reasonable steps to resolve the issue.</p>
                    </details>

                      <summary>Unintended results of the legislation </summary>
                      <p>Situations where the application of tax legislation has created tax consequences that are inequitable and contrary to the intent of the law may qualify for remission.</p>
                      <p>In these cases, remission may be recommended to correct that inequity. Broad public interest considerations, such as the integrity of the self assessment tax system, may also be considered.</p>
                    </details>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>You may be eligible for circumstances not listed here. For example, you might qualify if you paid more tax due to a delay in receiving a non-taxable retroactive lump sum from an organization, as a result of accident or disability. Circumstances beyond your control must have caused the delay. We will check that you took all appropriate actions within the applicable timelines. Delays must be caused by the organization issuing the lump sum payment.</p>
                <p>We consider each request on its own merits, based on relevant facts and your specific circumstances.</p>
