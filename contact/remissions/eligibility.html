                <p>Remission may be considered for a taxpayer (or group of taxpayers), including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>an individual</li>
                  <li>a corporation</li>
                  <li>a small business</li>
                  <li>a sole proprietorship</li>
                  <li>an employer or payer</li>
                  <li>a partnership</li>
                  <li>a trust</li>
                  <li>an estate</li>
                  <li>an organization, or</li>

                </ul>
                <p>They must have an amount which has been assessed and is paid or payable, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>federal income tax</li>
                  <li>the goods and services tax (GST)/harmonized sales tax (HST)</li>

                <h2 id="h-2">Request remission in extraordinary circumstances</h2>
                <p>A remission order is a rare and extraordinary measure that provides full or partial relief from tax, interest, penalty, or other debt where relief is warranted but cannot be achieved under the applicable laws through an assessment or other actions.</p>
                <p>Remission, which has the effect of excusing one taxpayer from the same tax laws which apply to all other taxpayers, is rare and usually considered only in exceptional circumstances. . As such, requests are subject to an in-depth review process, involving many considerations. Historically, very few cases reviewed by the CRA have resulted in remission being granted.</p>

                <h3>Situations and examples</h3>
                <p>Remission guidelines emphasize a set of common characteristics based on past, successful remission requests.</p>
                <p>These are not meant to limit the matters that may be considered when determining if remission could be supported, but can provide some context for your eligibility.</p>
                
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                  <li>
                    <details>
                      <summary>Extreme hardship</summary>
                      <p>In some cases, remission may be considered when a taxpayer is faced with extreme financial hardship. The hardship should exist at the time the taxpayer makes the remission request and normally will have existed from the time the original tax debt arose. It should be of such severity that the taxpayer's current and anticipated resources are not adequate to resolve it. A taxpayer's ability to pay the debt throughout the period under review may also be examined.</p>
                      <p>When establishing the severity of hardship for individuals, CRA officials will consider the impact that paying the amount owing would have on the taxpayer. Factors such as age, health, available resources, and income levels may be examined. Annual family income (including the total income of the individual's spouse or common-law partner) for the year for which remission is requested and each subsequent year is compared against the low income cut-offs (LICO) established by Statistics Canada for the geographical area in which the taxpayer resides.</p>
                    </details>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <details>
                      <summary>Financial setback</summary>
                      <p>Situations of financial setback must include <strong>at least one extenuating factor</strong>.</p>
                      <p>Financial setback is less severe than extreme hardship, and involves determining whether the payment of the debt would strain a taxpayer's limited financial resources. An extenuating factor must be present, reasonable in the circumstances, and clearly relate to the particular taxpayer and the debt that is the subject of the remission request.</p>
                      <p>An extenuating factor is usually a circumstance beyond the taxpayer's control. For example, this guideline may apply in cases where there is a direct link between a taxpayer's serious illness and their inability to meet their tax or filing obligations. In such cases, acceptable supporting documentation (such as medical reports) regarding the nature of the illness and how it rendered the taxpayer incapable of managing financial and personal matters is considered.</p>
                    </details>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <details>
                      <summary>Incorrect action or advice on the part of CRA officials</summary>
                      <p>Remission may also be considered when a taxpayer is required to pay additional tax because CRA officials have taken an incorrect action or have provided incorrect advice. However, the presence of an error alone would not generally support remission. The CRA will also consider other relevant factors including whether:</p>
                      <li>there is evidence of bad faith on the part of the taxpayer</li>
                      <li>the taxpayer could not reasonably have been expected to initiate timely actions to avoid or minimize the tax (or, for GST/HST, collect or remit the tax, or claim a rebate)</li>
                      <li>the taxpayer requests remission within a time period which enabled CRA officials to properly investigate the matter</li>
                      <li>there is verifiable evidence that CRA officials have taken incorrect action or given the taxpayer incorrect advice. In cases where there is no verifiable evidence, the facts are confirmed by other acceptable and credible means</li>
                      <li>it can be shown that the taxpayer could not reasonably have been expected to file a waiver or Notice of Objection or provide new information within the required time limits to resolve the problem by the usual means (for example, by providing additional representations during the course of an audit or objection)</li>
                      <li>the error was recognizable as such at the time of the assessment (on the assumption that all relevant facts were known) and not in light of subsequent events (such as a court decision that reverses a standard interpretation upon which the assessment is based)</li>
                      <li>actions or advice on the part of CRA officials may have misled or discouraged a taxpayer from taking timely or appropriate action</li>
                      <li>any advice given was, in fact, incorrect at that time and the taxpayer acted on the basis of that advice</li>
                      <li>the taxpayer had reason to believe that the CRA official was acting in an authorized capacity, and</li>
                      <li>another course of action, within the applicable legislation, was available to the taxpayer that would have significantly reduced the incidence of tax</li>
                      <p>To determine whether reasonable steps have been taken by a taxpayer to resolve the issue, the taxpayer's specific circumstances will be considered in the remission review.</p>
                    </details>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <details>
                      <summary>Unintended results of the legislation </summary>
                      <p>The application of tax legislation to certain transactions occasionally results in tax consequences that are clearly inequitable to a taxpayer and contrary to the intent of the law, and remission may be recommended to correct that inequity. Broad public interest considerations, such as the integrity of the self assessment tax system, may also be considered.</p>
                    </details>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <details>
                      <summary>Inequitable outcome</summary>
                      <p>Remission may also be considered when a taxpayer experiences an inequitable outcome in situations where they have paid additional tax due to a delay in the receipt of a non-taxable retroactive lump sum from an organization as a result of accident or disability. It must be clear that the delay was caused by circumstances beyond the taxpayer’s control. For example, the taxpayer has taken all appropriate actions within the applicable timelines and any delays can reasonably be attributed to the organization issuing the lump sum benefit payment.</p>
                    </details>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The guidelines above are not exhaustive and do not limit what circumstances may be considered. Each request is considered on its own merits, based on the facts and circumstances specific to that taxpayer. CRA officials consider all relevant facts and circumstances when reviewing a remission request and will seek out additional information and documentation as needed (for example, notes, correspondence and reports stored in the CRA systems that contain information about a taxpayer’s compliance history, past communication with the CRA, current or past employers, assets, income amounts and other financial information, information found in court decisions or from third parties, credit reports, property and internet searches, or other relevant substantiation). </p>
                <p>When a taxpayer requests remission, it is important that they clearly articulate the reasons for their application (for example, financial setback with an extenuating factor) and specify the amount of relief they are asking for, as well as the taxation year(s) or period(s) related to the request. It is also important that taxpayers provide detailed substantiation to support their case (for example, documents such as financial statements and medical records). This type of information and documentation will assist the CRA in determining whether remission can be supported. </p>

                <h3>Examples of situations unlikely to qualify for remission</h3>
                <p>The following are examples of circumstances for which remission has not been recommended:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>circumstances that affect the population as a whole, such as a downturn in the economy</li>
                  <li>circumstances where the appropriate recourse belongs with a third party and not the CRA. This could include:
                    <ul>
                      <li>a taxpayer entered into an arrangement with a third party that turned out to be fraudulent</li>
                      <li>a taxpayer engages the services of a tax professional who makes an error or omission</li>
                      <li>a taxpayer enters into a business arrangement which has negative tax consequences and believes that there was misleading information or misrepresentation by the third party</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>circumstances where it would not be in the public interest to remit the tax, interest and/or penalty due to non-compliance, such as: 
                    <ul>
                      <li>the taxpayer missed deadlines as a result of a chronic history of non-compliance with filing and remitting obligations, or</li>
                      <li>the taxpayer exhibits an intentional avoidance or evasion of tax obligations or the payment of a tax debt</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>the remission request is an attempt to re-visit an audit, objection, consent to judgment or court decision because the requestor is dissatisfied with the results</li>
                  <li>the taxpayer did not request or file, within the statutory time limits, an amendment to a return, a reassessment, an election, a Notice of Objection, or further appeal a matter to court, and is attempting to use remission as a means of extending those time limits, and</li>
                  <li>circumstances where the integrity of tax or benefit administration would be compromised, or where granting remission, including the cumulative effect of a number of remissions, would be detrimental to public finances</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Even if the circumstances above are present, there may be additional circumstances or other valid reasons that would justify the CRA reviewing the request further</p>

                <h2 id="h-5">COVID benefit related amounts payable are not eligible</h2>
                <p>In 2020, the Government of Canada introduced a number of emergency benefits designed to help Canadians and businesses facing hardship as a result of the global COVID-19 outbreak. These benefits include the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS); and the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB).</p>
                <p>Any income received through these emergency benefits is taxable, and was widely advertised as such when they were introduced. Therefore, a remission order <strong>cannot be used</strong> by an individual or business which may now owe tax as a result of reporting income earned via these benefits.</p>
