          <h2 id="h-1">Situations that qualify</h2>
          <p>The Minister may grant relief from penalty or interest when the following types of situations prevent a taxpayer from meeting their tax obligations:</p>

          <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>
              <details>
                <summary>Extraordinary circumstances beyond your control</summary>
                <p>Penalties or interest may be cancelled or waived in whole or in part when they result from circumstances beyond a taxpayer's control. Extraordinary circumstances that may have prevented a taxpayer from making a payment when due, filing a return on time, or otherwise complying with a tax obligation include, but are not limited to, the following examples:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>natural or human-made disasters, such as a flood or fire</li>
                  <li>civil disturbances or disruptions in services, such as a postal strike</li>
                  <li>serious illness or accident</li>
                  <li>serious emotional or mental distress, such as death in the immediate family</li>
                </ul>
              </details>
            </li>
            <li>
              <details>
                <summary>Incorrect assessment or information provided by the CRA</summary>
                <p>The CRA may also cancel or waive penalties or interest when they result primarily from CRA actions, including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>processing delays that result in taxpayers not being informed, within a reasonable time, that an amount was owing</li>
                  <li>errors in CRA material which led a taxpayer to file a return or make a payment based on incorrect information</li>
                  <li>incorrect information provided to a taxpayer by the CRA</li>
                  <li>errors in processing</li>
                  <li>delays in providing information, resulting in taxpayers not being able to meet their tax obligations in a timely manner</li>
                  <li>undue delays in resolving an objection or an appeal, or in completing an audit</li>
                </ul>
              </details>
            </li>
            <li>
              <details>
                <summary>Inability to pay or financial hardship</summary>
                <p>The CRA may, in circumstances where there is a confirmed inability to pay amounts owing, consider waiving or cancelling interest in whole or in part to enable taxpayers to pay their account. For example, this could occur when:</p>  
                <ul> 
                  <li>a collection has been suspended because of an inability to pay caused by the loss of employment and the taxpayer is experiencing financial hardship</li> 
                  <li>a taxpayer is unable to conclude a payment arrangement because the interest charges represent a significant portion of the payments, or</li> 
                  <li>payment of the accumulated interest would cause a prolonged inability to provide basic necessities (financial hardship) such as food, medical help, transportation, or shelter; consideration may be given to cancelling all or part of the total accumulated interest</li> 
                </ul>  
                <p>Consideration would not generally be given to cancelling a penalty based on an inability to pay or financial hardship unless an extraordinary circumstance prevented compliance, or an exceptional situation existed. For example, when a business is experiencing extreme financial difficulty and enforcement of such penalties would jeopardize the continuity of its operations, the jobs of the employees, and the welfare of the community as a whole, consideration may be given to providing relief of the penalties.</p>
                <p>For requests to cancel or waive interest or penalties based on an inability to pay or financial hardship, the CRA requires full financial disclosure from taxpayers, including a statement of income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. To help individual taxpayers provide full financial disclosure, please see <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/cancel-waive-penalties-interest/statement-income-expenses-assets-liabilities-individuals.html"> <span>Statement of Income and Expenses and Assets and Liabilities for Individuals</span> </a>.

              </details>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Even if your circumstances do not fall within one of the situations described above, the CRA may grant relief in similar situations, if you meet <mark>Perhaps there's a definition we can link to from legislation? Upon what set of criteria are 'other circumstances' reviewed?</mark></p>

          <h3>Relief is limited to the past 10 years</h3>
          <p>The Minister's discretion to grant relief is limited to any period that ended within 10 years before the calendar year in which a request is submitted or an income tax return is filed.</p>
          <p>The 10-year limitation period rolls forward every January 1.</p> 

          <details>
            <summary>Penalty, election, and refund or adjustment requests under the Income Tax Act</summary>
            <p>A taxpayer has 10 years from the end of the calendar year in which the tax year or fiscal period at issue ended to make a request to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) for relief to:</p>  
            <ul> 
              <li>cancel or waive penalties;</li> 
              <li>accept a late, amended, or revoked income tax election; or</li> 
              <li>issue a refund or adjustment beyond the normal three-year period</li> 
            </ul>  
            <p>This means that for requests or income tax returns that are filed in the current calendar year, the Minister has no authority to provide relief when the request is for a tax year or fiscal period that ended more than 10 years before the calendar year in which the request is made.</p>  
            <div class="well">
              <h3>Example</h3>
              <p>To be eligible for consideration, an initial request or income tax return filed during the 2015 calendar year must deal with an issue related to the taxpayer's 2005 and later tax years (or fiscal periods). A request or return related to a taxpayer’s 2004 and previous tax years (or fiscal periods) is not eligible for consideration since those tax years (or fiscal periods) are beyond the 10-year period.</p>

            <p>Under the 10-year limitation period, the Minister may cancel or waive interest that accrued within the last 10 calendar years before the year the request is made for any tax year or reporting period.</p>
            <div class="well">
              <h3>Example</h3>
              <p>An initial request made during the 2015 calendar year related to any interest that accrued during the 2005 and later calendar years, for any tax year or reporting period, is eligible for consideration. Any interest that accrued before January 1, 2005, is not eligible for consideration.</p>

            <p>Regarding a GST/HST return for a reporting period that ended within 10 years before the calendar year in which the request is made, the Minister may cancel or waive all or a portion of the:</p>  
            <ul> 
              <li>failure to file a return penalty payable under section 280.1;</li> 
              <li>failure to electronic file penalty payable under section 280.11; and</li>

A request made for a reporting period that ended more than 10 years before the calendar year in which the request is made is not eligible for consideration.</p> 
            </div>
            <p>The Minister may also grant relief from the 6% GST/HST failure to remit penalty payable before April 1, 2007, under former section 280 and similar penalties that accrued under the non-GST/HST portion of the <em>Excise Tax Act</em>. For these penalties, the Minister may cancel or waive the penalty that accrued within the last 10 calendar years before the year the request is made for any reporting period.</p>  
            <div class="well">           
              <h3>Example 2</h3>
              <p>An initial request made during the 2015 calendar year related to the failure to remit and similar penalties that accrued during the 2005 and later calendar years, for any reporting period, is eligible for consideration.

          <h2 id="h-5">After you make a request</h2>
          <p>It is a general CRA practice for another CRA official, or a committee of CRA officials, to prepare a decision report for the designated official's consideration, including a recommendation on whether or not granting relief is warranted. The final decision, including notifying you of the decision, is the responsibility of the designated official.</p>
          <p>When the review of your request is underway, we may contact you if we need any clarification of the facts and reasons, or to obtain any missing information.</p>
          <p>In all cases, once the review of your request is complete, we will notify you of our decision, including the reason for the decision if it is only partially approved or denied.</p>
          <p>Find out more about <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/complaints-disputes/cancel-waive-penalties-interest/approval-denial-your-request.html">how we review your request</a>.</p>

          <h3>Recourse if your request is denied</h3>
          <h4>Second administrative review</h4>
          <p>If you believe the CRA did not properly exercise its discretion in considering your request, you can ask for a second review. You may request a second review by writing to the address provided in the decision letter you received in reply to your first request for relief, or by writing to the Intake Centre responsible for your province or territory of residence.</p>
          <p>A second review request requires the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the reasons why you disagree with the CRA's decision, e.g., not all information was considered, certain facts or details were missing or misinterpreted or not considered in their proper context</li>
            <li>any relevant new documents, new facts, or correspondence</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To maintain impartiality and transparency, the second review will not be conducted by the CRA official involved in the first review and decision.</p>
          <p>The CRA may still uphold its previous decision following a second review of your request for relief. If you feel that the discretion was not properly exercised during the second review, you can apply to the Federal Court for a judicial review of the CRA decision within 30 days of the date you received the CRA second review decision.</p>
          <h4>Judicial review</h4>
          <p>If you believe the CRA did not properly exercise its discretion in arriving at the decision, you can apply for judicial review of that decision to the Federal Court within 30 days of the date you received the CRA decision.</p>

          <h3>Remission</h3>
          <p>If your request to cancel or waive interest or penalties is denied, but you believe you still have grounds for your request, you might still be able to make a remission request.</p>
          <mark>Is there more we can include here to make it clear what would differentiate the remission request from a second review?</mark>
