	<h2 id="h_1" class="toc">Overview</h2>
      <p>The individual is considered markedly restricted in hearing function if, <strong>even with</strong> appropriate therapy, medication, and devices (for example, adaptive aids), they have significantly or severely disordered hearing skills.</p>
      <p>There must be a severe impairment in hearing function all or substantially all of the time and this impairment should have lasted or is expected to last for a continuous period of at least one year.</p>
      <p>A qualified practitioner needs to certify that the impairment is severe and prolonged by completing the Disability Tax Credit  Certificate, (otherwise known as Form T2201).</p>
      <div class="alert alert-info provisional">
        <h3>Reminder</h3>
        <p>The credit acknowledges that for those with impacted health, there are additional costs and/or additional time needed to carry out  basic acitivies of dailly living.  The DTC supports those individuals or their caregivers by reducing their tax payable. </p>
        <br>
        <p>A medical diagnosis is not sufficient enough to qualify an individual for the DTC. The same diagnosis can vary between people in impact, scope, and outcome.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If the individual does not have severe and prolonged effects in this one category, they <strong>can combine this category with with any other of the impacted health categories</strong> to show the full impact on their health. </p>

      <h3>Can hear, but highly impacted</h3>
		<p>The Federal Court has made it clear that in assessing hear, the physician should have regard to a normal setting rather than the artificially quiet setting of a Doctor's office. In this regard the Federal Court stated:</p>
		<blockquote><p>The Court is satisfied that a quiet setting does not mean a doctor's office. The Court is satisfied that a quiet setting does not mean a sound booth in an audiologist's office. The Court is satisfied that the quiet setting must be the normal setting that a person encounters during the day when they are performing the functions of daily living. That means in a room talking with people, that means in a house when their parents are there, when there may be other activities going on, when they are preparing dinner or perhaps where the phone is ringing or when other conversations are going on. It does not mean that a person has to be able to hear when there is a substantial amount of noise or an extraordinary amount of noise. It is in between, but surely it must refer to a normal situation in which a normal person would find themselves during the context of conducting their life during a normal day.</p>
		</blockquote>
