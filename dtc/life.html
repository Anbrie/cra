	<h2 id="h_1" class="toc">Overview</h2>
      <p>Individuals who require life-sustaining therapies (LSTs) are eligible for the DTC because of the time required to administer these therapies. These are therapies that are life-long and continuous, requiring close medical supervision. Without them, the individual could not survive or would face serious life-threatening challenges. Close medical supervision is defined as monitoring or visits, at least several times annually, with a health provider. </p>
	<p>A qualified practitioner needs to certify that the impairment is severe and prolonged by completing the Disability Tax Credit  Certificate, (otherwise known as Form T2201).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <div class="alert alert-info provisional">
        <h3>Reminder</h3>
        <p>The credit acknowledges that for those with impacted health, there are additional costs and/or additional time needed to carry out  basic acitivies of dailly living.  The DTC supports those individuals or their caregivers by reducing their tax payable. </p>
        <br>
        <p>A medical diagnosis is not sufficient enough to qualify an individual for the DTC. The same diagnosis can vary between people in impact, scope, and outcome.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If the individual does not have severe and prolonged effects in this one category, they <strong>can combine this category with with any other of the impacted health categories</strong> to show the full impact on their health. </p>
      </div>
      <h2 id="h_2" class="toc">Eligibility criteria</h2>
		<p>You must meet <strong>both</strong> of the following criteria:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>The therapy is&nbsp;needed to support a vital function, even if it&nbsp;eases the symptoms.</li>
		<li>The therapy is needed at least <strong>3 times</strong> per week, for an average of at least <strong>14 hours</strong> a week.</li>
		</ul>
      <h3>What counts in the 14-hour requirement</h3>
		<p>You must dedicate the time for the therapy&nbsp;– that is, you have to take time away from your normal, everyday activities to receive it. It includes the time you&nbsp;need to set up a portable device. For example, you may have to dedicate time for chest physiotherapy to ease breathing or need kidney dialysis to filter blood.</p>
		<p>If&nbsp;the therapy requires a regular dosage of a&nbsp;medication that needs to be adjusted daily, the time spent on activities directly related to determining the dosage and administering the medication can be&nbsp;counted in&nbsp;the 14 hours per week requirement. For example, time spent on the following activities for insulin therapy:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>checking blood glucose levels</li>
		<li>preparing and administering the insulin</li>
		<li>calibrating necessary equipment</li>
		<li>testing ketones</li>
		<li>keeping a log book of blood glucose levels</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If a child cannot&nbsp;do the activities related to the therapy because of their age, the time spent by the child’s primary caregivers to do and supervise these activities <strong>can</strong> be counted&nbsp;in the 14 hours per week requirement.</p>
        <h3>What does not count in the 14-hour requirement</h3>
		<p>Some activities <strong>do not</strong> count in the 14 hours per week requirement, such as:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>the time a portable or implanted device takes to deliver the therapy (such as an insulin pump, a CPAP machine, or a pacemaker)</li>
		<li>activities related to dietary restrictions or regimes, even when these activities are a factor in determining the daily dosage of medication (such as carbohydrate calculation)</li>
		<li>activities related to exercising, even when these activities are a factor in determining the daily dosage of medication</li>
		<li>travel time to receive the therapy</li>
		<li>going to medical appointments (other than appointments where the therapy is received)</li>
		<li>buying&nbsp;medication</li>
		<li>recuperation after therapy</li>
		</ul>

        <h3>Transcript</h3>
        <p>For some people, life-sustaining therapy is required to support a vital function.</p>
        <p>In this first example, a person with cancer is having a follow-up appointment with the doctor to discuss their chemotherapy treatment.</p>
        <p>The chemotherapy was done over a six-month period, three weeks on and three weeks off.</p>
        <p>Doctor: "How are you managing with your chemotherapy?"</p>
        <p>Patient: "I'm extremely tired all of the time and unable to walk for an extended period of time, especially during the week following the treatment. I'm also not eating much because I've been experiencing nausea, and I've lost my sense of smell."</p>
        <p>Doctor: "I'm going to recommend that you try a new dietary supplement. I'm also going to send you for some blood tests and X-rays. I would like to see you again in two weeks to discuss the results."</p>
        <p>While there is no doubt that the individual has a serious illness, they would not qualify for the disability tax credit under the life-sustaining therapy criterion at this time because they do not receive therapy at least 3 times per week, for an average of at least 14 hours per week.</p>
        <p>In this second example, a person who has Type 1 diabetes is having a follow-up appointment with the doctor. The person has been using an insulin pump for over a month.</p>
        <p>Doctor: "How are you finding the insulin pump?"</p>
        <p>Patient: "Using the insulin pump has freed up a lot of time and has allowed me to have a more normal routine."</p>
        <p>Since the pump administers the insulin on an on-going basis, the time required for the pump to administer the insulin is not counted however the activities directly involved in determining and administering the dosage, are considered part of the therapy and count toward the 14-hour per week requirement. This includes activities such as monitoring blood glucose levels, changing tubing, rotating insertion sites, calibrating necessary equipment, ketone testing and maintaining a log book of blood glucose levels.&nbsp;Therefore, this person may qualify for the disability tax credit.</p>
        <p>In this third example, a six-year-old child and their parent are at the doctor's office for a regular check-up.</p>
        <p>The child was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes <span class="nowrap">13 months</span> ago.</p>
        <p>Doctor: "How are you managing with the insulin therapy?</p>
        <p>Parent: "We have established a routine for the therapy, but we are still having some difficulty balancing the dietary regime and exercise and the insulin requirements."</p>
        <p>Doctor: "How are you feeling about getting the shots?"</p>
        <p>Child: "I don't really like it much because I have to stop playing, and at night my parents have to wake me to check my blood."</p>
        <p>The child would qualify for the disability tax credit under the life-sustaining therapy criterion because all of its requirements are met, all or substantially all of the time.</p>
