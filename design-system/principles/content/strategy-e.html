 <p>You need to:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
<li><span class=fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> Collect and interpret data about user needs</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> Use this data to decide how, when and where to present relevant information</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> Simplify complicated information so users can understand it</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> Structure and tag content so that search engines and users can find what they need</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> Help people in a variety of circumstances and with a range of abilities use the information to complete their task</li>
<li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> Manage content lifecycle and strategically review, update and remove content when it is no longer relevant</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-2">heading</h2>
<p>It is impossible to design great user experience for bad content. If users cannot understand what they are  reading, or if it is confusing or unnecessarily long, they cannot have a good  user experience.</p>
		<p>Duplicate and competing sources of information across a site  confuse and frustrate users. It often makes them give up on a task. If your content does not meet users&rsquo; needs,  you cannot meet your business objectives.</p>
      <p>In order to consistently generate good content that  meets users&rsquo; needs it is important to have a strategy. A content strategy involves planning,  prioritizing, developing, and managing content.</p>
      <p>Having a strategy helps  you:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span>Plan what content to publish, when and where, as  well as identify who is accountable for it</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span>Prioritize content based on user and business needs,  while respecting the context of the whole web content system (entire intranet  or external website). Prioritizing content means focusing on the content that you are the authoritative owner of. It means limiting the amount of information to key messages which support a limited number of priorities</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span>Establish a workflow for content development, approval,  evaluation, and review</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span>Set benchmarks and criteria to measure success of your  business goals</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Effective content  strategy ensures your content is:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span>authoritative</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span>free of ROT and up to date</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span>found easily through search and browsing</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span>like water, able to adapt to different purposes and contexts, and is easily shared and reused</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span>well coordinated and comprehensive</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To create useful and usable content that  enables you to meet your business needs, each area needs to develop  a specific content strategy prior to creating content. Ensure that  it aligns with the overarching content strategy for the whole organization, and continuously evolves.</p>
      <p>Executing your content strategy means you have to commit to managing your  content through its life cycle. Content can become less useful over time. Low content use, among other indicators, should trigger a content review.</p>
      <p>To ensure that content remains relevant and current, content owners need  to regularly review all of their pages and hyperlinks. Additional reviews may  be necessary to respond to specific user feedback or legislation changes. Work  together with an analytics team to determine how often users access your  content and whether it is still valuable.</p>
      <p>Identify redundant, outdated, or trivial content, and  submit a request to remove it. When you remove content from an online  environment, you are still responsible for keeping business records offline for  the required retention period. </p>
      <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <p> No amount  of research, information architecture, interaction design, or usability testing  can&nbsp;create a great user experience if the content isn&rsquo;t useful and  usable&mdash;if it doesn't help the user&nbsp;to get things done.</p>

	  <h2 id="h_3">Reuse,  recycle, and reduce content</h2>
	  <p>You are ready to develop  your content after you do the following:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span>Review what content is out there and who owns it</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span>Identify your users&rsquo; needs and  business objectives</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span>Develop a content strategy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Without  good content, strategy, design, search, metadata (proper title, description, and keywords) or any other technical  improvement cannot help users find the right information. Proper websites  require a content strategy and governance. Content  requires consolidation and responsible management across the entire content  ecosystem. This is the only solution to information overload. </p>
      <p>Individual project  deliverables greatly impact the content ecosystem. While your business initiative  might be great on its own, when you place it in the context of other  initiatives and other information, these initiatives can cancel each other out.  They can also compete for users&rsquo; limited  attention. Ensure your initiative is part of the solution, not  part of the problem:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span>Consider broad  impacts of what you plan to publish</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span>Coordinate new initiatives with other  areas that have similar content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Innovation does not mean creating more of  something new. You can contribute to healthy innovation by reusing and  recycling what is already there:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span>Reuse content by <a href="links-e.html">linking to content correctly</a>. For other options,  speak to your web team, as there may be ways to dynamically add content from another page, ensuring that a single and consistent source of information can be attached to multiple pages
          <ul>
            <li>Remember that  dynamic content can change without notice. Make this part of the  strategy to ensure correctness or completeness</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span>Recycle content by working with the area that created the  original content to adapt it to meet multiple needs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you want to reuse and  recycle content from outside your organization, be mindful of copyright.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>If there is no  content that you can reuse or recycle, create&nbsp;less content, reduce your  existing content, and limit users&rsquo; options:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span>Consolidate all the  information users need to know about a topic or task in as few places as  possible</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span><a href="findability-e.html#h_13">Do not create disconnected FAQ's</a></li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span>Limit related content to as few links as possible, both in-text and in other areas of the page. Only add related links if there is proof this information is actually relevant to the users at that point in time</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check fa-li text-success"></span>Remove  old pages when new, more effective content replaces it. This ensures  users find only the most current and useful information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Less content is not  only more user-friendly, but it is also more strategic. A single instance of  information leads to consistent, streamlined process, accountability, ability  to measure success, and improves organizational agility.</p>
      <p>Too much content results in negative impacts on both users and the organization:</p>

	  <h2 id="h-4">Copyright implications</h2>
	  
	  <h3 id="h-4-1">Understanding what copyright is</h3>
      <p>Content providers either create their own content or provide content written by another public servants and host it on a goverment site. Sometimes this content includes additional information from a third party, and risks copyright infringement. </p>
      <p>Copyright is the exclusive legal right to produce, reproduce, publish or perform an original literary, artistic, dramatic or musical work in any form. Copyright typically exists in and protects the following: books, pamphlets, articles, cartoons, product manuals, computer programs, films, plays, scripts, musical compositions, songs, paintings, sculptures, photographs, architectural plans, <abbr title="and so forth">etc</abbr>. <strong>This list is not exhaustive.</strong> </p>
      <p>The creator of the work is usually the copyright owner. <strong>However, an employer owns the copyright in material created by its employees when the work is made in the course of employment</strong>, unless there is an agreement in place stating otherwise. Copyright in work created by employees of the Government of Canada is typically owned by the Government, unless there is a written agreement stating otherwise.</p>
      <p>Copyright attaches automatically upon the creation of an original work in tangible form without the need for marking with a copyright notice. However, copyright owners often mark their work with a copyright notice which has the symbol &copy; or the word “Copyright”, the name of the copyright owner and the year of first publication. Also, the following words are often added to a copyright notice “All rights reserved”. While the use of a copyright notice is not required under Canadian law, it is often used to signal to people that the work is protected by copyright. <strong>Copyrighted work is protected with or without copyright notices</strong>. (For example, a photographic image obtained off the internet)</p>
      <p>The copyright owner has the right to control how their work is used. Others who want to use the work must obtain the right to do so: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>usually with a contract </li>
        <li>a license agreement </li>
        <li>a subscription </li>
        <li>or written permission from the copyright owner</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>No Copyright in ideas</h4>
      <p><strong>Copyright protection does not extend to facts, ideas, or information</strong>. Copyright protects the particular way that an author expresses the ideas, facts or information. In other words copyright protects an author’s manner of expression. For example, a history textbook on Canadian confederation is protected by copyright, but the facts on which the book may be based, such as the date of confederation, the creation of the British North America Act, are not. </p>
      <h3 id="h-4-2">Impacts of copyright infringement</h3>
      <p><strong>Copyright infringement violates Canadian copyright laws</strong>. It can expose the Agency to legal action. Damages can be in the thousands or tens of thousands of dollars <strong>per infraction</strong>, depending on the infringement. Additional costs can include the legal fees and time spent preparing for and defending the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>The reputation of the  Government of Canada risk being damaged when they are the subject of a legal action. Copyright lawsuits are public and can be reported in the news and on social media.</p>
      <h3 id="h-4-3">Obtaining copyright permission</h3>
      <p>If you purchase or otherwise obtain the right to use a copyrighted work either through a license, a subscription, online terms of use or other form of contract, then you must look to the terms of the applicable agreement to determine if your proposed use of the copyrighted work is permitted. The terms of the applicable agreement set out the permitted uses and restrictions on use in respect of the copyrighted work. These terms <strong>must be</strong> adhered to. </p>
      <section class="alert alert-danger">
        <p>If you are not aware of the document or the terms that set out the user rights, assume the material is copyright protected. Permission to use will have to be obtained from the copyright owner. </p>
      </section>
      <p>Email or write to the owner of the material and request permission to use. Ensure that your request contains sufficient information and details to enable the recipient to understand the permission that is being sought. The request should at a minimum include the following information: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Explain clearly what work </strong>you want to use and how you wish to use it </li>
        <li><strong>Identify the work </strong>that you wish to use
          <ul>
            <li>Be specific </li>
            <li>For example, it is not enough to ask the copyright owner to use &quot;all&quot; of the images on their site or to make copies of &quot;some&quot; of their manuals </li>
            <li>In the example of a manual, identify the manual name, the product name, product version, manual version and anything else that will enable the reader of the request to understand what is being asked </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      <p>If the copyright owner grants permission to use copyrighted materials, use the materials <strong>only</strong> as per the terms of the permission. <strong>Do not</strong> use the materials in any other way unless you obtain additional permission for that specific ‘new’ use. For example, if the content owner has given you permission to post materials on the internet, if you want to reproduce the materials to be included in a handout at a conference, you must again ask for permission.</p>
      <p>In the case of materials created by a commercial entity you may need to send the request to a public relations office, legal department, or general contact email address.</p>
      <p><strong>Do not rely on permission provided verbally. Written permission </strong> must <strong>be obtained</strong> to ensure there is a record of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Who gave permission </li>
        <li>How to contact the person that gave permission </li>
        <li>What was permitted </li>
        <li>When was permission provided </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="alert alert-danger">
        <p>An email is sufficient for legal purposes. As well, and very importantly, if permission is obtained the responsible program area must track usage to ensure that use of the materials is in fact in accordance with the permission that was obtained. </p>

We have written a product evaluation for &quot;Product X&quot; and would like to include your official photos and the user manual of the product to provide our users with additional information.

        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Obtaining permission may take a long time, so you should factor that into your publishing plan. <strong>Do not assume</strong> that you will get permission from the content creator. They may refuse.</p>
      </div>
      <h3 id="h-4-4">Scope of copyright</h3>
      <p><strong>Your own work</strong><br />
        it is your decision if you want to copy and distribute your own work. You may authorize people to use your work freely or in a restricted way. Remember that copyright for content you create for your employer in the course of your employment does not belong to you. It belongs to your employer, unless you have an agreement that states otherwise.</p>
      <p><strong>A non substantial portion of the work </strong><br />
        a non substantial portion of a work may include quoting a few sentences from an article or book, or a few words from a short poem or song. The source and the creator must be indicated along with the quote. </p>
      <p>If quoting more than a few sentences at a time, consider whether the amount copied is large in relation to the size of the source. For example, quoting several sentences from a small news article could be considered substantial. </p>
      <p>As well, the question of what is a substantial portion of a work takes into consideration more than just quantity. It is important to also consider the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the quality of material copied </li>
        <li>the importance of the parts to the author's work </li>
        <li>the purpose for which the material was copied </li>
        <li>whether the work was copied to save time and effort </li>
        <li>whether the material is used in the same or a similar fashion as the author's </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The analysis of whether a portion of copyrighted work is substantial or non substantial requires a complex legal analysis<strong>. If in doubt seek legal input from </strong> the legal department, <strong>or ask permission from the copyright owner. </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Works in which copyright has expired</strong><br />
        In Canada copyright exists for the life of the author (the remainder of the calendar year in which the author dies) and a period of fifty years following the end of that calendar year. Other rules apply to determine the period of copyright when the author is unknown, or when there are joint authors. Material for which copyright has expired may be copied without restriction. This is the reason that there are so many different publications of literary classics, for example, those written by Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters. </p>
      <p><strong>Creative commons licenses or other open use licenses</strong><br />
        Creative commons or other open use licenses offer creators a spectrum of licensing choices. These range from: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>allowing downloading and sharing the work for non-commercial purposes, provided no changes are made to the shared work </li>
        <li>allowing sharing work that is changed for non-commercial purposes only </li>
        <li>allowing sharing work that is changed for commercial purposes </li>
        <li>charging license fees for commercial use </li>
        <li>charging for 'extras' such as for a physical printed version </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="alert alert-warning">
        <p><strong>Use care when reproducing materials</strong> with a Creative Commons or other open use type of license. Read the terms of the license carefully. Always ensure your use is permitted under the applicable license terms. The terms and conditions of each license are different. Different Creative Commons licenses permit different uses at the option of the creator. For example, the creator might permit sharing of their work provided you do not change it. As well, if you copy, the Creative Commons licenses requires that you use the same licensing terms, identification of the creator, a copyright notice, as well as a notice that refers to the disclaimer of all warranties and limitation of liability. </p>

      <p><strong>Government of Canada (&quot;<abbr title="Government of Canada">GoC</abbr>&quot;) works</strong><br />
        <abbr title="Government of Canada">GoC</abbr> material can be reproduced for personal or public non-commercial purposes unless there is language or terms that say you can't. Check the &quot;Terms and conditions&quot; section of the Government agency's website to make sure.</p>
      <p><strong>Note: </strong>if you want to revise, adapt, or translate a <abbr title="Government of Canada">GoC</abbr> work you must get permission.</p>
      <p><strong>Hyperlinks</strong><br />
        In general, the use of external hyperlinks are permitted. However, if access to the hyperlinked site is through a subscription, or if a technological protection measure controls access to the site or work, then permitted use of the material will be in accordance with the subscription or other agreement terms. </p>

          <p>Unless the contract explicitly contains terms regarding reproduction of materials, a procurement arrangement with a vendor does not automatically entitle your organization to copy the vendor’s materials. The terms of the applicable contract must be reviewed to determine if the desired use is permitted. If the contract’s terms do not deal with the desired use, whether this is posting a manual on the intranet, making copies of a product manual, or making copies of software, then permission must be obtained.

          <p>Licensing the use of an image will provide you with the right to use only as per the specified terms of use. The licensing terms will identify the permitted uses, and will also contain limits on what can be done with the images. Often use of the images will be limited to a specific medium, and may be limited in terms of use in other ways. For example, an image may be licensed for a printed publication with less than 100,000 impressions. Posting the image on the internet would require permission and payment of additional fees. </p>

      <h3 id="h-4-6">Your role</h3>
      <p>If you want to copy or distribute material consider the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assume the material is copyright protected </li>
        <li>Determine the source of the material
          <ul>
            <li>For example, was it obtained from the internet, from a subscription, was it delivered as part of a contract </li>
            <li>Determine if a subscription, license agreement or other contract applies and, if so, what the terms are </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Look at the agreement to determine if a proposed use is permitted </li>
        <li>Determine if a proposed use is permitted under the terms of the applicable agreement or licensing terms and the limitations of that use
          <ul>
            <li>For example:
              <ul>
                <li>Is distribution allowed </li>
                <li>Is copying allowed </li>
                <li>Is there a limit to the number of users for a license </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Ask in writing for permission for the specific use if the contract prohibits the use or does not specifically allow it </li>
        <li>Ask in writing for permission for the specific use when there is no license agreement, subscription or contract </li>
        <li>Assume when copying is permitted that the copied material must contain a notice attributing ownership to the copyright owner and a statement prohibiting any further copying </li>
