        <h3 class="mrgn-tp-0">Required</h3>
        <p> The use of plain language is a requirement of the <cite><a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=30682">Directive on the Management of Communications</a></cite>. </p>
      </section>
      <p>Writing in plain language doesn't mean over-simplifying or leaving out critical information. Using plain language actually makes critical information accessible and readable for the target audience.</p>
      <p>By writing plainly and simply, you: </p>
      <ul class="fa-ul lst-spcd">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> increase the chances that people will find, read and understand your information from any device</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> make your information more accessible to people with disabilities</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> allow people who are reading your information on a small screen to see essential information first</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> save resources when editing and translating your text</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> improve task completion and cuts costs by, for example, reducing enquiries</li>
      </ul>
	<h2 id="h-2">Avoid jargon, idioms, and expressions </h2>
      <p>Where possible, avoid using jargon, idioms, and expressions. Use the clearest, most popular term for your audience.</p>
      <p>Legal and technical terms and "government-speak" confuse most people.</p>
      <p>People who don't speak English or French might use online tools to translate text. These tools don't always translate idioms and expressions accurately. </p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul class="list-unstyled lst-spcd mrgn-lft-lg">
        <li>Bench warrant = <strong>Jargon</strong><br>
          <span class="text-muted">(an order by a judge to arrest someone who didn't show up in court or comply with certain conditions)</span></li>
        <li>To hire a helping hand = <strong>Idiom</strong><br>
          <span class="text-muted">(meaning to hire an employee)</span></li>
        <li>Attack your least favourite task first = <strong>Expression</strong><br>
          <span class="text-muted">(meaning do your least favourite task first)</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mrgn-tp-lg">If you must include jargon familiar to your target audience, be sure to: </p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> explain it using simple, familiar words or give an example to help non-specialists understand</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> never use jargon to explain jargon</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> You have to file your income tax return (T1) by April 30.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-ban text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> You have to file your T1 return by April 30.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> Learn about savings plans that can help you save enough money to retire.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-ban text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> Learn about different types of savings plans that will let you build up your retirement nest egg.</li>
      </ul>
	<h2 id="h-3">Abbreviations and acronyms</h2>
	 <p>Don't use an abbreviation or acronym unless it's better known to the widest audience than its long-form equivalent. For example: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>EI</li>
        <li>RCMP</li>
        <li>T4</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have to use a multi-word term more than once on a web page, use the full term the first time you use it. For any further uses of the term:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>use a short form such as "the program" or "the plan," in lower case instead of repeating the full term or using an abbreviation</li>
        <li>only use an abbreviation for a secondary reference if analytics data or usability testing determines that people often use and search for the abbreviation </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Always spell out an abbreviation the first time you use it on a page.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> There are 15 client contact centres across Canada.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-ban text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> There are 15 CCCs across Canada.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> The&nbsp;act&nbsp;strengthens the Government of Canada's commitment to…</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-ban text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> The&nbsp;EEA&nbsp;strengthens the Government of Canada's commitment to… </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Include abbreviations that your audience uses in your metadata (for example, in the description field) to help search engines find your page more easily.</p>
      <section class="alert alert-info">
        <h4> Tip: avoid abbreviations and acronyms by rethinking the content </h4>
        <p>If your content contains a lot of abbreviations and acronyms, rethink its structure. Consider placing related content under distinct headings and sections.</p>
        <p>For example, when introducing legal requirements, use the title of the act once, if necessary, and then talk about what people "must" do. The context will make it clear that the things they "must" do are requirements under the act. Don't use the abbreviation for the act, because it makes the text harder to follow. </p>
        <p>Close the topic before referring to other obligations under different legislation.</p>
      </section>
      <h4 id="h_4_2_1">Latin abbreviations</h4>
      <p>Avoid using e.g. and i.e. Use clearer alternatives instead, for example:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> for example, such as, or like</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-ban text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> e.g.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> that is, in other words</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-ban text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> i.e.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may use these abbreviations when space is limited, for example, in a table or a figure.</p>
      <h3 id="h_4_3">Use words in transition consistently</h3>
      <p>Words and expressions in transition are those written commonly in 2 or more different ways. Reduce confusion by using the following spellings: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>website (not "web site")</li>
        <li>web page (not "webpage")</li>
        <li>web (not "Web")</li>
        <li>email (not "e-mail")</li>
        <li>online (not "on line")</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="h_4_4">Use of ampersand</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Spell out the word "and" instead of using an ampersand (&amp;)</li>
        <li>Use the ampersand only for proper names when it's part of a company name and in certain abbreviations, including:
          <ul>
            <li>R&amp;D (research and development)</li>
            <li>O&amp;M (operating and maintenance)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
	<h2 id="h-4">Use simple sentences</h2>
	<p>Keep sentence structure simple by putting the subject and the verb at the beginning of the sentence and by using the subject + verb + object construction. This structure helps the reader understand what the subject of the sentence is doing by placing the subject first, followed by the verb.</p>
      <p>Avoid complex and compound sentences. They generally contain too much information for people to understand when they're scanning.</p>
      <p>Example (replace complex sentence structures with direct statements):</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> Learn about Canada's transportation system. Find information about using paved roads, bike trails, airports and ports across the country. </li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-ban text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> Canada's vast transportation system enables millions of people each year to travel throughout the country, around the world, and to work and back. From this page you can access a wealth of transportation information related to travelling and commuting.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example (replace noun strings (a series of 2 or more nouns used to name something) with direct statements)</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> You have until April 30 to file your tax return.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-ban text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> The period of time that you have to file your tax return ends on April 30.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example (surround a long sentence with shorter ones because it helps people understand the long sentence)</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> The evaluation team will submit its final report on the training program in September.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-ban text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> The training program evaluation team will submit its final report in September.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <mark>(Note to rewrite)...the above "subject+verb" model isn't want the guide uses...instead it does this: Write direct statements, and start with the verb when you describe  actions. Eliminate any descriptive information that precedes the verb.</mark>
      </p>
      <h3 id="h_5_1">Comma use</h3>
      <p>Remove unnecessary commas to make web content easier to read: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>avoid multiple commas in a sentence by breaking it up into a few shorter sentences</li>
        <li>place a comma before "and" and "or" only if it will help people understand a list of items in a sentence</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="h_5_2">Hyphen and dash use</h3>
      <p>Hyphens and dashes have different uses. They aren't interchangeable. Avoid using dashes: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>use a hyphen (-) to join words together</li>
        <li>use "to" instead of the en dash (–) in a span or range of numbers, dates or time</li>
        <li>use a comma (,) to emphasize or frame an idea instead of an em dash (—) </li>
        <li>simplify your sentence instead of using em dashes</li>
      </ul>
	  
	  
	<h2 id="h-5">Use short sentences and paragraphs</h2>
	<p>Be concise. Use as few words as possible to express an idea. By being concise, you'll help everyone, even specialists, complete the task they set out to do.</p>
      <p>Keep sentences and paragraphs short to make them easier to scan on any screen size. People who have learning disabilities may find it difficult to scan and understand long sentences and paragraphs. </p>
      <p>Try to keep sentences under 20 words. You can do this by:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> breaking long sentences into shorter ones</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> limiting each sentence to 1 idea </li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> removing unnecessary words</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> We received your request for funding and approved it.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-ban text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> We received your request for funding, which we've thoroughly reviewed and approved in a timely manner.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> We'll consider any type of investment.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-ban text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> Any type of investment will be taken into consideration.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mrgn-tp-lg">Try to keep paragraphs to 3 sentences. You can do this by:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> developing 1 main idea per paragraph </li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> presenting a series of more than 2 ideas or words as a vertical list</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> using a short form for a long title instead of repeating it</li>
      </ul>
	<h2 id="h-6">Active versus passive voice</h2>
	<dl class="dl-horizontal brdr-bttm">
        <dt>Active voice</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>In an active sentence, the subject does the action. The sentence is clear and direct.</p>
          <p> <strong>Example:</strong> We may ask you to provide proof of citizenship.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Passive voice</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>In a passive sentence, it may not be clear who or what is doing the action.</p>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> You may be asked to provide proof of citizenship.</p>
          <p>Passive voice creates confusion for readers; it is not clear who is responsible for the action.  Passive  voice results from the use of the verb "to be". To write in an active, positive voice, avoid the following 8 words:</p>
          <ul class="list-inline mrgn-bttm-md">
            <li class="mrgn-rght-lg"><span class="fas fa-ban text-danger"></span> is</li>
            <li class="mrgn-rght-lg"><span class="fas fa-ban text-danger"></span> was </li>
            <li class="mrgn-rght-lg"><span class="fas fa-ban text-danger"></span> were</li>
            <li class="mrgn-rght-lg"><span class="fas fa-ban text-danger"></span> are</li>
            <li class="mrgn-rght-lg"><span class="fas fa-ban text-danger"></span> am</li>
            <li class="mrgn-rght-lg"><span class="fas fa-ban text-danger"></span> been</li>
            <li class="mrgn-rght-lg"><span class="fas fa-ban text-danger"></span> being</li>
            <li><span class="fas fa-ban text-danger"></span> be </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Exception:</strong> When "is" &nbsp;describes a state of  being, it is not in a passive voice, and is freely used. For example: "Government is responsible for respecting Official Languages."</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>In an active    sentence, a person, thing, or an    entity does an action. In a passive sentence, the action is done to an object by a person,    thing or an entity.</p>

      <h3 id="h_7_2">Positive or negative form</h3>
      <p>Whenever possible, tell people what they may or must do instead of what they may not or must not do. Avoid negatives, double negatives and exceptions to exceptions.</p>
      <p>Example (positive/negative):</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong>You're entitled to part of the deduction.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-ban text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> You're not entitled to the entire deduction.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Examples (positive/double negative):</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> The procedure will be effective.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-ban text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> The procedure will not be ineffective.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> You may claim a child born in 1972 or earlier as a dependent, if he or she has a mental or physical disability.</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-ban text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> You may not claim anything for a dependent child born in 1972 or earlier, unless the child has a mental or physical disability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mrgn-tp-lg"><strong>Exception:</strong> If something has serious consequences, you can use the negative form to explain that something isn't possible or should not be done. </p>
      <ul class="fa-ul ">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> Do&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;try to locate the source of carbon monoxide. Leave your home immediately and move to fresh air. </li>
      </ul>
	<h2 id="h-7">Use verbs instead of nouns formed from verbs</h2>
	<p>Avoid using nouns that are formed from verbs. They can be vague. Verbs alone clearly express the action needed.</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> apply</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-ban text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> submit your application </li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> consider</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-ban text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> take into consideration </li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> modify</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-ban text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> make a modification </li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="fa-ul  mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span> <strong>Write:</strong> needs</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-ban text-danger"></span> <strong>Don't write:</strong> is in need of </li>
      </ul>
	   <p>Always use the simplest form of a verb. When possible, use the present tense.</p>
	<h2 id="h-8">Use gerunds (verbs that end in "ing") correctly</h2>
	<p>Gerund are words that are formed with verbs but act as nouns.  This is done by adding "ing" to the end of a verb.</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul">
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-check text-success"></span>Use gerunds in page titles and link names when the content is supporting the user's  understanding or learning of something</li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-li fa-ban text-danger"></span>Do no use gerunds for a specific call-to-action (the "doing" of something)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example, "Buying a computer" might contain different computer options, specifications, ratings, etc. "Buy a computer" is the act of actually buying it.</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <div class="row mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <div class="col-sm-5">
          <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li><strong>Heading: </strong> "Starting a business"</li>
            <li> <strong>Links:</strong>
              <ul class="lst-spcd">
                <li>"Planning a business"</li>
                <li>"Choosing a business name"</li>
                <li>"Registering your business with the government"</li>
                <li>"Applying for business permits and licences"</li>
                <li>"Getting business support and financing"</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-7"> <img src="images/gerund-e.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""> </div>
      </div>
      <p>For the call-to-action, use the active voice form of the verb. This means there is no  "ing". For example:</p>
      <div class="row mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <div class="col-sm-5">
          <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li><strong>Heading:</strong> <br>
              "Incorporating federally"</li>
            <li><strong>Call-to-action:</strong> <br>
              "Incorporate a business" </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-7"> <img src="images/gerund2-e.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""> </div>
      </div>
	<h2 id="h-9">Check the readability of the content</h2>
<h3 id="h-9-1">Understand the reading level of the audience</h3>
      <p>Readability scores indicate how much education your audience must have to understand the words on the page. 
        
        The higher the education, the more likely your audience can absorb the meaning of multi-syllabic words and sentences that are up to 20 words long. </p>
      <p>In Canada, literacy rates are mostly average or below-average. Statistics Canada surveys taken in 1994, 2003 and 2013 reveal that 48% of Canadian adults don’t have the literacy skills they need to live and work in today’s knowledge-based society.  That is why we have mandatory readability rates for genneral population pages.</p>
      <p>Specialized audience page can have a readability rate of up to Grade 15, but be warned. Less than 14% of the population can read at this level. </p>
      <p>Readability does not guarantee comprehension or that your page will be successful. It only means that your audience should be able to absorb the general meaning of the words, not necessarily the point the words are trying to make.</p>
      <p><strong>Remember:</strong> It’s not about you, it’s about your audiences.  Content is often written for management approval instead of for user consumption.  This approach often creates overly complex content.  Complexity is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>unhelpful and bureaucratic</li>
        <li>often perceived as arrogant and deceitful</li>
        <li>leads to distrust</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="h-9-2">Check content reading level</h3>
      <p>Check the reading level of your text. Make sure that it meets the reading level you're targeting based on the literacy needs of your audience. Do this every so often while you're writing content. You can use various tools to do this. </p>
      <p>Readability tools help you check if content is too wordy or complex. Writing content at a reading level above grade 8 can make it difficult for many people to understand or complete their task. </p>
      <p>You can use a readability tool like Flesch-Kincaid to check the reading level of your English content. This tool is available as part of Microsoft Word. It generally reflects the years of education needed to understand the text.</p>
      <p>To use Flesch-Kincaid: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>in Word 2010 and later, click the <strong>File</strong> tab, and then click <strong>Options</strong></li>
        <li>click <strong>Proofing</strong></li>
        <li>under <strong>When correcting spelling and grammar in Word</strong>, make sure the <strong>Check grammar with spelling</strong> check box is selected</li>
        <li>select <strong>Show readability statistics &nbsp;</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can check the reading level of a whole page or just part of a page. To check the reading level:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>accept any tracked changes</li>
        <li>place periods at the end of any bulleted items and headings (remove the periods before publishing) </li>
        <li>highlight the text in your Word document</li>
        <li>click the <strong>Review</strong> tab</li>
        <li>click <strong>Spelling &amp; Grammar</strong></li>
        <li>when Word has finished checking the text, it will ask whether you want to check the rest of the content</li>
        <li>click <strong>No</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>If your text contains technical terms that consist of long, multi-syllable words that you need to use for your specialized audience, remove these terms before you test the content for readability to see whether the surrounding text can be simplified. Reinsert the technical terms once you've simplified the surrounding text.</p>
      <p>The Readability Statistics dialog box will appear and show the Flesch-Kincaid grade level. </p>

      <p>In newer versions of Microsoft Word, search for "Flesch-Kincaid" using the help feature.</p>
      <h3 id="h-9-3">Reading level requirements</h3>
		<p>The Flesch-Kincaid grade level result is based on this formula:</p>
		<p>0.39 x (words/sentences) + 11.8 x (syllables/words) - 15.59</p>
      <p>Evaluate the reading level of content as follows for:</p>
      <ul class="fa-ul lst-spcd">
        <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> navigation content (home, theme and topic pages), <strong>aim for no higher than grade 8</strong></li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> all other content intended for general audiences, <strong>aim for grade 8 or lower</strong></li>
        <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span> content intended for experts, determine the appropriate grade level and apply it across all content for this audience</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="h-9-4">Verify whether the content is easy to understand</h3>
      <p>Readability tools reveal the reading level of your content, but they can't tell you whether it makes sense. </p>
      <p>To check whether your content is easy to read and understand, test it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ask colleagues who aren't familiar with the subject to review the text for clarity and logic</li>
        <li>work with your communications team to set up usability testing for your content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your content has a high reading level, or if usability testing shows low task completion, try to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>shorten words, sentences or paragraphs, but keep words of 3 or more syllables if they're well known</li>
        <li>replace technical jargon with terms that people will understand</li>
        <li>remove details that people don't need to complete the task</li>
        <li>replace secondary references to a program with "program" rather than using its full name or abbreviation</li>
        <li>create numbered or bulleted lists for key tasks</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="h-9-5">Examples</h3>
