    </ul>
	<h2 id="h-1">Format types</h2>
	<p>Once you have a good <a href="audience-e.html">understanding of your audience's needs</a>, find the best way to present information to them.</p>
	<p>Content does not always have to be text. You should pick the format that will be the most effective.</p>

<p>Ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the best way to communicate the information your audience needs?</li>
<li>What format will make it easiest to understand the information quickly?</li>
<li>Will this format work well for all the different audiences?</li>
<li>Who might be excluded if you use a specific format?</li>
</ul>
 <h3>Principle online formats</h3>
<p>There are many formats that you can consider including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static webpages to structuring and laying  out information</li>
<li>Dynamic webpages to allow the user to interact or modify content</li>
<li>Images to illustrate</li> 
<li>Tables to compare or filter data</li>
<li>Videos to share stories or explain a process</li>
<li>Social media to promote initiatives</li>
<li>Calculators</li>
<li>Interactive checklist to focus people’s attention and reassure them</li>
<li>Wizards for guided answers</li>
</ul>

	 
  
		
		<h3>Other online formats</h3>
		 <dl class="dl-horizontal">
		  <dt>Word </dt><dd>documents are great for templates or other  types of information that require easy edits</dd>
        <dt><abbr title="Portable document format">PDF</abbr>s </dt><dd><p>are best used for official or legal  publications</p>
          <ul>
            <li>They preserve the integrity of the content and layout of the  document</li>
            <li>Generally they are not meant for edit</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt><abbr title="Powerpoint file">PPT</abbr>s</dt><dd> <p>are used for delivering presentations and  if published online</p>
          <ul>
            <li>They are only ideal when you anticipate someone else might  want to present the same presentation or use it as a template</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>Excel</dt><dd> is meant for sharing tabular data</dd>
      </dl>
     
      <p>When documents are published online in formats other than <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, such as  Word, <abbr title="Portable document format">PDF</abbr>, <abbr title="Powerpoint file">PPT</abbr>, or Excel, it creates a number of issues because these formats  are not primarily meant for the web:</p>
      <ul class="lst-spcd">
        <li>Inaccessible information because documents are  not created with <a href="#h-3">web principles in mind</a></li>
        <li>Incomplete information&nbsp; because document format and layout (such as a <abbr title="Powerpoint file">PPT</abbr> slide or an infographic in a <abbr title="Portable document format">PDF</abbr> format) may restrict the amount and type  of information communicated</li>
        <li>Unresponsive documents which do not adjust to  meet users&rsquo; needs in different online contexts (such as mobile)</li>
        <li>Duplicated information that takes up more server  space, which results when multiple formats are available for the same  information </li>
        <li>Conflicting information, which results when  multiple formats are available for the same information, but only one format  gets updated while the others are forgotten</li>
        <li>Documents that are difficult to update because  of format restrictions (for example a <abbr title="Portable document format">PDF</abbr> of an infographic would take lots of  effort, time and money to update if a problem or usability issue is found  because the document was designed with specific presentation and visuals in  mind in a finite amount of document space, making addition of any extra  information impossible)</li>
        <li>Unsustainable practices are reinforced as  alternative formats are created for print, and therefore encourage printing of  documents</li>
        <li>Inflexible information which cannot be reused as  it is locked down in specific document formats and cannot be extracted by a  content management system (<abbr title="content management system">CMS</abbr>)</li>
      </ul>
      
      
    
	<h2 id="h-3">Understand the difference between print and web</h2>
	 <p>Content  that ends up online often starts with an author opening up a print-based  program, like Microsoft Word. As a result, the author may unknowingly create a product  that is best suited for print, not the web. This is a key problem as the two  environments are very different. </p>
      <p>In a book there is an obvious start and stop point. The information  is presented as text on paper, with the possibility of supporting images. In a movie that is based on that same book, the paper becomes a luminous  environment without text. It &nbsp;relies instead  on moving imagery, colour, and dialogue. Although the core story is the same, the mediums are very different, as  a screenplay adapts the content from paper to  film.</p>
      <p>Similarly,  a product that is created for print must be adapted to work well on the web. If  the goal is to have the primary version of your content exist as a web page,  ensure you write your content for the web, not for print. Rework headings, change the layout, and rewrite text. This ensures information is  easy for the user to discover.</p>
      <p>As we continue to rely heavily on responsive web design, which automatically adapts content to different browsers and devices for an optimal viewing experience, authors have to create intelligent content. Intelligent content is structured and categorized for automated reuse and adaptation across different platforms. This concept is also known as "content like water". Content is designed in a way that is flexible, so it can flow anywhere.</p>
      <p>It is also  essential to understand users&rsquo; constraints in a changing web environment, such  as: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Reading text on a mobile device is like reading through a peephole</li>
        <li>Viewing with less screen space means less visible context and less  understanding</li>
        <li>Prioritizing and presenting most important information up front is required &minus; especially when lots of information resources exist</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Government requires that all web content is accessible. An  accessible web allows all users to access it, regardless of their browser,  device, resolution, settings or ability. Improve the accessibility of  the web to improve the usability for all users; this is the main principle of  universal design. </p>
     
      <p>Much like how shoppers quickly scan a store's shelves and racks for a specific item, users scan webpages for specific information. The item a shopper wants may in fact be in the store, but if they can't easily find it, they leave. The same applies to users and webpages. Users leave the webpage or website altogether if it is an effort to find the information they seek.</p>
      <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <p>In linear media &mdash; such as print and TV &mdash; people expect you to construct their experience for them. Readers are willing to follow the author's lead.</p>
        <p>In non-linear hypertext, the rules reverse. Users want to construct their own experience by piecing together content from multiple sources, emphasizing their desires in the current moment. People arrive at a website with a goal in mind, and they are ruthless in pursuing their own interest and in rejecting whatever the site is trying to push.</p>

	<h2 id="h-4">Avoid FAQs</h2>
	<p>Do not create standalone pages with frequently asked questions (FAQs).</p> 

<p>FAQ pages are often created as a band-aid solution to either:</p>
<ul>
<li>a content structure problem
 <blockquote>
                  <p></p>
               
               <footer class="text-right mrgn-bttm-md">Canada Revenue Agency<br>
                  <cite><a href=""></a></cite>
               </footer></blockquote></li>
<li>an ownership problem<blockquote>
                  <p></p>
               
               <footer class="text-right mrgn-bttm-md">Canada Revenue Agency<br>
                  <cite><a href=""></a></cite>
               </footer></blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>Answer to questions should be at the point of need, next to the relevant context, not on a separate page.</p>


<p>Research shows that FAQs:</p> 
<ul>
<li>are not the first place where people look for an answer to their question; they only go there when they already can’t find what they need elsewhere</li>
<li>make it hard for people to find information</li>
<li>can lead to duplication and contradictory information</li>
<li>date easily and become irrelevant to users' needs</li>
</ul>
