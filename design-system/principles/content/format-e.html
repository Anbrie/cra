	<h2 id="h-1">Understand the difference between print and web</h2>
	 <p>Content  that ends up online often starts with an author opening up a print-based  program, like Microsoft Word. As a result, the author may unknowingly create a product  that is best suited for print, not the web. This is a key problem as the two  environments are very different. </p>
      <p>In a book there is an obvious start and stop point. The information  is presented as text on paper, with the possibility of supporting images. In a movie that is based on that same book, the paper becomes a luminous  environment without text. It &nbsp;relies instead  on moving imagery, colour, and dialogue. Although the core story is the same, the mediums are very different, as  a screenplay adapts the content from paper to  film.</p>
      <p>Similarly,  a product that is created for print must be adapted to work well on the web. If  the goal is to have the primary version of your content exist as a web page,  ensure you write your content for the web, not for print. Rework headings, change the layout, and rewrite text. This ensures information is  easy for the user to discover.</p>
      <p>As we continue to rely heavily on responsive web design, which automatically adapts content to different browsers and devices for an optimal viewing experience, authors have to create intelligent content. Intelligent content is structured and categorized for automated reuse and adaptation across different platforms. This concept is also known as "content like water". Content is designed in a way that is flexible, so it can flow anywhere.</p>
      <p>It is also  essential to understand users&rsquo; constraints in a changing web environment, such  as: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Reading text on a mobile device is like reading through a peephole</li>
        <li>Viewing with less screen space means less visible context and less  understanding</li>
        <li>Prioritizing and presenting most important information up front is required &minus; especially when lots of information resources exist</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Government requires that all web content is accessible. An  accessible web allows all users to access it, regardless of their browser,  device, resolution, settings or ability. Improve the accessibility of  the web to improve the usability for all users; this is the main principle of  universal design. </p>
      <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <p>Since the visitor of the page is the only person who clicks the mouse and therefore decides everything, user-centric design has become a standard.</p>
        <p>Basically, users' habits on the Web aren't that different from customers' habits in a store. Visitors glance at each new page, scan some of the text, and click on the first link that catches their interest or vaguely resembles the thing they're looking for. In fact, there are large parts of the page they don't even look at.</p>

      <p>Much like how shoppers quickly scan a store's shelves and racks for a specific item, users scan webpages for specific information. The item a shopper wants may in fact be in the store, but if they can't easily find it, they leave. The same applies to users and webpages. Users leave the webpage or website altogether if it is an effort to find the information they seek.</p>
      <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <p>In linear media &mdash; such as print and TV &mdash; people expect you to construct their experience for them. Readers are willing to follow the author's lead.</p>
        <p>In non-linear hypertext, the rules reverse. Users want to construct their own experience by piecing together content from multiple sources, emphasizing their desires in the current moment. People arrive at a website with a goal in mind, and they are ruthless in pursuing their own interest and in rejecting whatever the site is trying to push.</p>

	<h2 id="h-2">Avoid multiple and alternative formats</h2>
      <p>Information can be published online in many different formats . Each  format has a specific purpose:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr></strong> format is meant for structuring and laying  out information on the web</li>
        <li><strong>Word </strong>documents are great for templates or other  types of information that require easy edits</li>
        <li><strong><abbr title="Portable document format">PDF</abbr>s </strong>are best used for official or legal  publications
          <ul>
            <li>They preserve the integrity of the content and layout of the  document</li>
            <li>Generally they are not meant for edit</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong><abbr title="Powerpoint file">PPT</abbr>s</strong> are used for delivering presentations and  if published online,
          <ul>
            <li>They are only ideal when you anticipate someone else might  want to present the same presentation or use it as a template</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Excel</strong> is meant for sharing tabular data</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While different formats can be used online based on a specific need, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is the best format for online content. </p>
      <p>When documents are published online in formats other than <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, such as  Word, <abbr title="Portable document format">PDF</abbr>, <abbr title="Powerpoint file">PPT</abbr>, or Excel, it creates a number of issues because these formats  are not primarily meant for the web:</p>
      <ul class="lst-spcd">
        <li>Inaccessible information because documents are  not created with web principles in mind</li>
        <li>Incomplete information&nbsp; because document format and layout (such as a <abbr title="Powerpoint file">PPT</abbr> slide or an infographic in a <abbr title="Portable document format">PDF</abbr> format) may restrict the amount and type  of information communicated</li>
        <li>Unresponsive documents which do not adjust to  meet users&rsquo; needs in different online contexts (such as mobile)</li>
        <li>Duplicated information that takes up more server  space, which results when multiple formats are available for the same  information </li>
        <li>Conflicting information, which results when  multiple formats are available for the same information, but only one format  gets updated while the others are forgotten</li>
        <li>Documents that are difficult to update because  of format restrictions (for example a <abbr title="Portable document format">PDF</abbr> of an infographic would take lots of  effort, time and money to update if a problem or usability issue is found  because the document was designed with specific presentation and visuals in  mind in a finite amount of document space, making addition of any extra  information impossible)</li>
        <li>Unsustainable practices are reinforced as  alternative formats are created for print, and therefore encourage printing of  documents</li>
        <li>Inflexible information which cannot be reused as  it is locked down in specific document formats and cannot be extracted by a  content management system (<abbr title="content management system">CMS</abbr>)</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <p>Structuring content for reuse means we can create, publish  and use content more efficiently. We can assemble and reassemble it for  different products, audiences, devices or contexts of use. Information embedded  in documents makes this process difficult, if not impossible. [&hellip;] Content  volume also affects findability. The &ldquo;we could put that online&rdquo; mentality runs  unchecked when publishing is as easy as &lsquo;save as <abbr title="Portable document format">PDF</abbr>&rsquo; and upload. Websites can  turn into massive filing cabinets &mdash;making website visitors wade through more  links and search results to find what they&rsquo;re looking for. Perhaps they  never will. The World Bank said recently that over 31% of its reports had never  been downloaded.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Our usability testing often shows people have  more problems with content in <abbr title="Portable document format">PDF</abbr> documents than web pages. They click a  link and start an unexpected or unwanted download. The download fails, or they  bail out when they see how big the file is. People sometimes struggle to  navigate a large document with print layouts, huge graphics and no internal  bookmarks. &nbsp;Often the information they want is in a single paragraph. <abbr title="Portable document format">PDF</abbr>s  can make hard work of simple information needs.</p>

      <p>Once you define users' tasks, determine the information they need to  complete those tasks: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep information specific to  the tasks </li>
        <li>Present it logically or  sequentially in a location where users expect to find it</li>
        <li>Ensure information is timely  and relevant, not redundant or trivial</li>
        <li><a href="findability-e.html#h_12">Avoid multiple and alternative formats </a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since you can&rsquo;t identify all user needs, and because these needs change,  content creators should provide users with a feedback mechanism. Content  owners should be open to users' suggestions for changes and modifications. </p>
      <h2 id="h_13">Avoid <abbr title="Frequently asked questions">FAQ</abbr>'s</h2>
      <p><abbr title="Frequently asked questions">FAQ</abbr> pages are often created as a band-aid solution to an otherwise messy content  environment. Contrary to improving discovery of important information, <abbr title="Frequently asked questions">FAQ</abbr>'s are generally not user-friendly.  They tend to:</p>
      <ul class="lst-spcd">
        <li> Separate information from the context in which it needs to  be understood </li>
        <li> Duplicate information </li>
        <li> Make users look for information in multiple places</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since  most <abbr title="Frequently asked questions">FAQ</abbr>'s are long and contain varied information, users find them frustrating  They have to go through a long list of questions without knowing if they can find  the answer they need. Also, multiple pages  equal more waiting time, as each page has to load.</p>
      <p>In  general, users&rsquo;  questions are best answered in context with other information on the same  topic. Instead of having multiple pages on a single topic, find where the  content already exists.  Restructure the page to include the necessary  information. Do not create an extra <abbr title="Frequently asked questions">FAQ</abbr> page.</p>
      <blockquote class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
        <p>Frequently  asked questions usually aren&rsquo;t questions asked by the reader, but rather are  important information dumped in the <abbr title="Frequently asked questions">FAQ</abbr> section by the content editor. In most  cases, <abbr title="Frequently asked questions">FAQ</abbr> content is not where users expect to find it, which makes users&rsquo;  experience frustrating and less than informative.</p>
        <p>If you&rsquo;re thinking about  adding <abbr title="Frequently asked questions">FAQ</abbr>s, consider reviewing the content on your website that is generating  questions and think about how you can change the content or design to answer  the question &mdash; or provide an answer in context to prevent people from visiting  an additional webpage to find the answer. </p>
