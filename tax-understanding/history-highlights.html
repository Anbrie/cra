	<h2 id="h_1" class="toc">Taxes in the world</h2>
		<p>Since the beginning of recorded history, a tax system of some kind has always existed in organized societies and governments. Over 3,500 years ago, the ancient Egyptians collected taxes and the Roman Empire had a highly evolved tax system.</p>
<p>The French and Romans of the 13th century were credited with the first use of a word similar to tax. The French had taxer and the Latin used taxare to describe the acts: to estimate, to assess, or to touch repeatedly.</p>
		
	<h2 id="h_2" class="toc">Taxes in Canada</h2>
	<p>Canada’s tax system has evolved over many years to accommodate the needs of an increasingly complex society. The tax system needs to benefit all Canadians and should be flexible so the government can use it to achieve specific social and economic objectives.</p>	
		
      <h3>Before Confederation</h3>
      <p>The colonial governments collected taxes, usually through customs duties, and sent them to the two mother countries, England and France.</p>
      <h3>Canada becomes a nation</h3>
      <p>Following Confederation in 1867, the new government was given the power to raise money by taxation and responsibilities were divided between the federal and provincial governments. The most expensive areas of responsibility such as building railways, roads, bridges, and harbours, became the responsibility of the federal government. The provincial governments assumed responsibility for education, health, and welfare.</p>
      <h3>Britain declares war on Germany</h3>
      <p>As a British colony, Canada joined World War&nbsp;I at Britain's side in 1914. The pressures of financing the war resulted in increasing customs and excise taxes, and in 1916, the federal government began collecting corporation tax.</p>
      <h3>Government needs revenue to finance war</h3>
      <p>In 1917, as a temporary measure to help finance the war, the federal government introduced the Income Tax War Act, covering both personal and corporate income. &quot;I have placed no time limit upon this measure . . . a year or two after the war is over, the measure should be reviewed,&quot; stated Sir Thomas White, Minister of Finance.</p>
      <h3>War ends, expenses continue</h3>
      <p>After the war ended in 1918, the government still needed to pay for war-related expenses such as veterans’ pensions and debt interest, and so in 1920, the federal government introduced sales tax.</p>
      <h3>Income tax is here to stay</h3>
      <p>By 1948, income tax was no longer considered temporary and the Income War Tax Act was replaced with the Income Tax Act.</p>
