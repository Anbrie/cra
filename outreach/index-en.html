<section>
<p>If your organization provides services to certain populations in Canada, the Outreach program at the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) can help. We offer assistance all across Canada to help organizations educate their clients about the benefits and credits they may be entitled to. </p>

<li>Newcomers to Canada or refugees</li>
<li>Seniors</li>
<li>Students and youth</li>
<li>Persons with disabilities</li>
<li>Housing-insecure, homeless, or individuals staying in a shelter</li>
<li>Modest-income Canadians</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Organizations who support these groups</h3>

	<h2>What CRA outreach officers can do</h2>

<p>(*Host a booth or deliver a presentation at an event you are organizing)</p>

		<h3>Host a free tax clinic</h3>
<p>The CRA works with community organizations and their volunteers to help eligible individuals by doing their taxes for free, which ensures they get the benefit and credit payments to which they are entitled.</p>

<p>As a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic, community organizations in partnership with the CRA’s Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (CVITP) and the Income Tax Assistance – Volunteer Program in Quebec will be hosting free virtual tax clinics.Virtual clinics connect eligible individuals with trained volunteers who will complete and file their tax return by videoconference or phone, for free.</p>
