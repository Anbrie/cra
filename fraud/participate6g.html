		 <h2 id="h-1">Overview</h2>
	<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is warning Canadians about getting involved in tax schemes including purported offshore disability insurance plans. Promoters, including tax representatives and tax preparers, are claiming that taxpayers can get tax-free amounts from a corporation and the corporation can get a tax write-off using employer disability insurance plans provided by supposed offshore insurer.</p>
	
<h2 id="h-2">How it works</h2>
<h3>What types of disability insurance plans are of concern</h3>
<p>A genuine <a href="/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/insurance/disability.html">disability insurance</a> plan is a financial product that typically provides a monthly income, if you cannot work due to unexpected illness or injury. These insurance products are normally legitimate ways for employers to insure against risks associated with the health of their employees.</p>
<p>A disability insurance plan should outline the details of an insurance policy, along with the payment details, liabilities and stipulations of the insurance and insurer.</p>
<p>However, certain schemes that purport to provide disability insurance are not providing insurance. In general terms, these schemes are financed with no-risk loans from an offshore lender with a participant (usually an employer) being required to pay the net proceeds of the supposed insurance to an offshore entity under a separate side agreement. Although this communication piece highlights offshore arrangements, similar concerns can arise with respect to domestic arrangements with the same or similar characteristics.</p>
<h3>How does an offshore disability insurance plan scheme work</h3>
<p>An offshore disability insurance plan is an arrangement under which a promoter sells a corporate taxpayer disability insurance. The corporate taxpayer makes a deposit (directly or indirectly, through a health and welfare trust) with a foreign corporation. Through a series of transactions, the foreign corporation allegedly loans the funds to the corporate taxpayer's shareholder/employees or related parties on a limited-recourse basis (i.e., without risk). The shareholders/employees or related parties then loan the same amount of funds to the corporate taxpayer.</p>
<p>The corporate taxpayer paying the so-called insurance premiums is assured most of its deposit will be loaned back to the corporate taxpayer's shareholders/employees or related parties and then returned to the corporate taxpayer. All of these transactions are done under the guise of a disability insurance plan.</p>
<p>The promoter of these offshore money transfers claim they are a legal way to avoid tax. For example, the promoter may claim:</p>
<ul>
<li>one or more non-arm's length individuals including employees can receive tax-free amounts from a corporate taxpayer</li>
<li>the corporate taxpayer may deduct an insurance premium expense</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why is this a scheme</h3>
<p>Funds circle into and out of Canada in amounts that are claimed as large insurance expenses in order to avoid Canadian income tax.</p>
<p>These deductions are a multiple of the actual funds that the participants paid under the schemes out of their pre-existing wealth with a substantial portion of those actual funds being used to pay the promoters' fees (commissions).</p>
<p>The products would not have otherwise been issued in the absence of other interdependent contracts. The CRA has, to date, found that the amounts individuals are receiving are taxable and the premiums are not deductible in-part because the so-called insurance is not insurance.</p>

	 <h2 id="h-3">What we are doing</h2>
 <p>The CRA reviews leveraged insurance products to determine whether they are valid or just a vehicle to obtain a specific tax advantage.</p>
