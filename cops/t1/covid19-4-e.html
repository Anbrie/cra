<h2 id="h_1">Payment deadline for your 2020 taxes</h2>
<p>The payment and filing deadline for 2020 taxes is April 30, 2021. </p>
<p>It is important to file your tax return on time to ensure your benefit payments and other credits continue without disruption. If you owe taxes, it is equally important to pay your balance owing by the deadline to prevent additional interest and penalties from being added to the amounts you already owe.</p>
<p>If you file and pay any amounts you owe by the deadline, you will avoid:</p>

<ul>
<li>a daily compound interest that starts on May 1, 2021 on unpaid amounts </li>
<li>a 5% late-filing penalty that applies if you have a balance owing, plus an additional 1% for each month (up to a maximum of 12 months) that you file after April 30, 2021 </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_2">Pay your amount owing</h2>
<p>When you file your return and have an amount on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-48500-balance-owing.html">line 48500</a>, this means you have a balance owing. If this your first time with a tax debt or if you are unsure of what do next, the CRA can work with you to find the best way to resolve your debt.</p>
<p>You have several options to pay your taxes, including online, in-person, or using a third-party service provider. If you owe less than $2 in taxes, you do not have to make a payment.</p>
<p>If you are able to pay the full amount you owe by the deadline, you avoid paying interest and penalties on top of what you already owe. </p>
<p>Even if you cannot pay your balance owing on or before April 30, 2021, you can avoid the late-filing penalty, if you file your return on time. </p>
<p>If you are not able to pay the full amount all at once, you can make a partial payment to pay what you can afford. This reduces the amount of interest you need pay on unpaid amounts.</p>
<p>Make sure your payment is paid to the right debt (to avoid misallocated payments)</p>
<p>Find a payment option that works for you: </p>
 <p><a class="btn btn-call-to-action ip-btn" href="/en/revenue-agency/services/make-a-payment-canada-revenue-agency/make-payment.html">Make a payment</a></p>
<p>Do we have information on how someone can confirm the payment is received?</p>

<h2 id="h_3">If you cannot pay in full</h2>
<p>If you are not able to pay the full amount you owe to the CRA, we will work with you to resolve your tax debt.</p>
<p>Use the following tools to help you determine what you can afford to pay on a regular basis: </p>

<ul>
                    <li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/when-you-money-collections-cra/worksheet-disclaimer.html">Income and expense worksheet</a> </li>
				  <li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/when-you-money-collections-cra/calculator-disclaimer.html">Payment arrangement calculator</a></li>
				  
               
                  </ul>
<p>After you have determined how much you can pay on a regular basis, you have options to set up regular payments yourself or if you need additional help, you can contact the CRA to help set up a payment schedule (payment arrangement) that works for you. </p>

<p><strong>Set up regular payments yourself</strong><br />- going into My Account, can set up their own payment arrangement without contacting the CRA</p>
<p><strong>Contact the CRA to help set up a payment schedule</strong><br />- set a schedule to pay a partial amount on regular basis<br />- can pay what they can afford and pay the rest as a scheduled payments<br />- cannot pay any amount- what are the options</p>
<p>The CRA will work with you to find a payment arrangement that fits your budget: </p>

 <ul>
<li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/when-you-money-collections-cra/personal-debt.html">Make a payment arrangement</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For other options:</p>

<p>Paying in arrears (if you have to pay taxes for a previous year)</p>
<p>You may have received a notice of assessment or reassessment, or a Statement of Account/Remittance, which shows that you owe taxes for 2020 or for a previous year.</p>
<h2 id="h_4">Confirm your payments</h2>
<p>Link to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/looking-a-payment.html">Confirm your payment</a></p>
<h2 id="h_5">How to avoid owing income tax in the future</h2>
<p>There are many scenarios which may impact the amount of income tax you have to pay. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>you are self-employed </li>
<li>you have multiple pension or income sources </li>
<li>you took maternity or parental leave and received both a top up and EI benefits </li>
</ul>

<p>Ways to avoid income tax debt: </p>

<ul>
<li>Complete form TD1, Personal Tax Credits Return to allow your employer or payer to deduct additional tax from your pay cheque or your pension </li>
<li>Make voluntary payments to the CRA (instalment payments) </li>
</ul>
<p>For a better understanding of taxes, review the online course, Learning about taxes.</p>
<p>Also payment in arrears. </p>
