	    <p>The CRA understands that individuals might be dealing with difficulties in meeting their financial obligations, including paying tax debts they may have incurred prior to or during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p> If you cannot pay an existing debt in full, you may be eligible to <a href="#entering">enter into a payment arrangement</a>. Payment arrangement options are being expanded to reflect current realities resulting from COVID-19 and give Canadians more time and flexibility to repay based on their ability to pay.
</p>-->
        <h2 id="partial">Make a payment arrangement on your own </h2>
        <p>If you cannot pay the full amount of your balance owing, but know you can afford to pay your balance over a period of time, you can set up a payment arrangement yourself without having to contact the CRA.</p>
	      <p>You can start paying what you owe by making a partial payment to the CRA. By doing this, you have entered a payment arrangement which will end once your balance is paid in full.</p>
	      <p>There are several options to set this up yourself, such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Pay by pre-authorized debit in CRA My Account</li> 
	<li>Pay through your financial institution</li>
	<li>Send post-dated cheques to the CRA to cover your balance owing</li>
	      </ul>

	      <p>For more options and other details: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/make-a-payment-canada-revenue-agency/make-payment/general-payment.html">Payment options for individuals</a></p>

	      
         
       
        <h2 id="entering">Call the CRA to make a payment arrangement </h2>
        <p>If you have a more complex situation and need help to figure out how much you are able to pay, the CRA will work with you to find the best way to pay your amount owing.</p>
	      <p>You can make a payment arrangement with the CRA that allows you to make smaller payments to pay your amount owing over a period of time.</p>
	      <h3>Steps to determine what you can afford to pay over time</h3>
