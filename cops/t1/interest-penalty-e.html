<h2 id="h_1">Interest</h2>
<p>If you have a balance owing for the current tax year and are unable to pay it by the payment due date, the CRA will start charging you compound daily interest as of <span class="nowrap">May 1, 2021</span>. 
	<p>The rate of interest the CRA will charge on current or previous balances can change every 3 months based on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/prescribed-interest-rates.html">prescribed interest rates</a>.</p>
		    <h3 id="h_1_1">Interest relief if you received COVID-19 benefits</h3>
		    
 <p>Interest relief on 2020 taxes owing will be given to people who have a total taxable income of $75,000 or less and received at least one COVID-19 benefit in 2020. For details: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/taxes/income-tax/personal-income-tax/covid19-taxes/interest-relief.html">Eligibility criteria for interest relief</a></p>
		    
		    <h3 id="h_1_2">Interest on required tax instalments </h3>
		    
 <p>If you owed taxes in the previous tax year of a certain amount, the CRA may require that you pay your taxes owing by instalments before you file your tax return. These instalments are paid 4 times a year and if you miss those payment deadlines, you will need to pay instalment interest. For details: <a href="instalments-interest-e.html">Quarterly tax instalments: Interest and penalty </a></p>


    



	
	<h2 id="h_2">Penalties</h2>
    

    
         <h3 id="h_2_1">Late-filing penalty</h3>
		    <p>The late-filing penalty is applied if you file your tax return after the April 30 due date and have a balance owing. If you cannot pay your balance owing, you should still file by the due date to avoid paying the late-filing penalty.</p>
	
		    <p>The late-filing penalty is <strong>5%</strong> of your 2020 balance owing, <strong>plus an additional 1%</strong> for each full month you file after April 30, 2021, to a maximum of <strong>12 months</strong>.</p>
		    
<p>If the CRA charged a late-filing penalty on your return for 2017, 2018, or 2019 your late-filing penalty for 2020 may be <strong>10%</strong> of your 2020 balance owing, <strong>plus 2%</strong> of your 2020 balance owing for each full month you file after April 30, 2021, to a maximum of <strong>20 months</strong>.</p>
	    
 <h3 id="h_2_2">Repeated failure to report income penalty</h3>
<p>If you fail to report income of $500 or more on your tax return, at least twice within the last 4-year period, it is considered repeated failure to report income. You will have to pay a federal and provincial or territorial repeated failure to report income penalty.</p>
<p>The penalty is the lesser of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>10% of the amount you failed to report for federal </li>
<li>10% of the amount you failed to report for provincial or territorial</li>
<li>50% of the difference between the understated tax (and/or overstated credits) related to the amount you failed to report and the amount of tax withheld related to the amount you failed to report</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if you voluntarily tell the CRA about an amount you failed to report, the CRA may waive these penalties. For details: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/voluntary-disclosures-program-overview.html">Voluntary Disclosures Program</a></p>

</dd>

         <h3 id="h_2_3">False statements or omissions penalty</h3>
<p>You may have to pay a penalty if you, knowingly or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, have made a false statement or omission on your 2020 return.</p>
<p>The penalty is equal to the greater of:</p>
<ul>
<li>$100</li>
<li>50% of the understated tax and/or the overstated credits related to the false statement or omission</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if you voluntarily tell the CRA about an amount you failed to report and/or credits you overstated, the CRA may waive this penalty. For details: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/voluntary-disclosures-program-overview.html">Voluntary Disclosures Program</a></p>

    



    
        <h2 id="h_3">Cancel or waive penalties or interest</h2>
<p>The CRA administers legislation, commonly called the taxpayer relief provisions, that gives the CRA discretion to cancel or waive penalties or interest when taxpayers are unable to meet their tax obligations due to circumstances beyond their control.</p>
<p>The CRA’s discretion to grant relief is limited to any period that ended within 10 calendar years before the year in which a request is made.</p>
<p>For penalties, the CRA will consider your request only if it relates to a tax year or fiscal period ending in any of the 10 calendar years before the year in which you make your request. For example, your request made in 2021 must relate to a penalty for a tax year or fiscal period ending in 2011 or later.</p>
<p>For interest on a balance owing for any tax year or fiscal period, the CRA will consider only the amounts that accrued during the 10 calendar years before the year in which you make your request. For example, your request made in 2021 must relate to interest that accrued in 2011 or later.</p>
<p>To make a request fill out <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc4288.html">Form RC4288, Request for Taxpayer Relief – Cancel or Waive Penalties or Interest</a>.</p>
