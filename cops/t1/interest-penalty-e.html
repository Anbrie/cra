<h2 id="h_1">Interest</h2>
<p>If you have a balance owing for 2020, the CRA charges compound daily interest starting <span class="nowrap">May 1, 2021</span>, on <strong>any unpaid amounts owing</strong> for 2020. This includes any balance owing if the CRA reassesses your return. The rate of interest the CRA charges can change every 3 months. For details: <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/prescribed-interest-rates.html">Prescribed interest rates</a></p>
		    <h3 id="h_1_1">Interest relief if you received COVID-19 benefits</h3>
		    
 <p>Interest relief on 2020 taxes owing will be given to people who have a total taxable income of $75,000 or less and received at least one COVID-19 benefit in 2020. For details: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/taxes/income-tax/personal-income-tax/covid19-taxes/interest-relief.html">Eligibility criteria for interest relief</a></p>


    



	
	<h2 id="h_2">Penalties</h2>
    

    
         <h3 id="h_2_1">Late-filing penalty</h3>
<p>The CRA will charge you a late-filing penalty if you file your 2020 tax return after <span class="nowrap">April 30, 2021</span> and you owe tax that remains unpaid at that time. The penalty is <strong>5%</strong> of your 2020 balance owing, <strong>plus 1%</strong> of your balance owing for each full month your return was filed after <span class="nowrap">April 30, 2021, to a maximum of <strong>12 months</strong>.</span></p>
<p>If the CRA charged a late-filing penalty on your return <span class="nowrap">for 2017</span>, 2018, or 2019 your late-filing penalty <span class="nowrap">for 2020</span> may be <strong>10%</strong> of your 2020 balance owing, <strong>plus 2%</strong> of your 2020 balance owing for each full month your return was filed after <span class="nowrap">April 30, 2021</span>, to a maximum of <strong>20 months</strong>.</p>

		    <h4>Tax tip</h4>
<p>Even if you cannot pay your full balance owing on or before <span class="nowrap">April 30, 2021</span>, you can avoid the late-filing penalty by filing your return on time.</p>
    


  

    
 <h3 id="h_2_2">Repeated failure to report income penalty</h3>
<p>If you failed to report an amount on your return for 2020<strong> and</strong> you also failed to report an amount on your return for 2017, 2018, or 2019, you may have to pay a federal and provincial or territorial repeated failure to report income penalty. If you did not report an amount of income of $500 or more for a tax year, it will be considered a failure to report income.</p>
<p>The federal and provincial or territorial penalties are each equal to the lesser of:</p>
<ul>
<li>10% of the amount you failed to report on your return for 2020</li>
<li>50% of the difference between the understated tax (and/or overstated credits) related to the amount you failed to report and the amount of tax withheld related to the amount you failed to report</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if you voluntarily tell the CRA about an amount you failed to report, the CRA may waive these penalties. For details: <a href="/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/voluntary-disclosures-program-overview.html">Voluntary Disclosures Program</a></p>

    
<h4>For residents of Quebec</h4>
    

   
    
        <p>For residents of Quebec, only the federal penalty will be applied as the provincial tax is assessed by Revenu Québec.</p>
<h4>For non-residents and deemed residents of Canada</h4>
<p>For non-residents and deemed residents of Canada, the provincial or territorial penalty will be applied only if provincial or territorial tax is payable.</p>

    

    
         <h3 id="h_2_3">False statements or omissions penalty</h3>
<p>You may have to pay a penalty if you, knowingly or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence, have made a false statement or omission on your 2020 return.</p>
<p>The penalty is equal to the greater of:</p>
<ul>
<li>$100</li>
<li>50% of the understated tax and/or the overstated credits related to the false statement or omission</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if you voluntarily tell the CRA about an amount you failed to report and/or credits you overstated, the CRA may waive this penalty. For details: <a href="/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/voluntary-disclosures-program-overview.html">Voluntary Disclosures Program</a></p>

    



    
        <h2 id="h_3">Cancel or waive penalties or interest</h2>
<p>The CRA administers legislation, commonly called the taxpayer relief provisions, that gives the CRA discretion to cancel or waive penalties or interest when taxpayers are unable to meet their tax obligations due to circumstances beyond their control.</p>
<p>The CRA’s discretion to grant relief is limited to any period that ended within 10 calendar years before the year in which a request is made.</p>
<p>For penalties, the CRA will consider your request only if it relates to a tax year or fiscal period ending in any of the 10 calendar years before the year in which you make your request. For example, your request made in 2021 must relate to a penalty for a tax year or fiscal period ending in 2011 or later.</p>
<p>For interest on a balance owing for any tax year or fiscal period, the CRA will consider only the amounts that accrued during the 10 calendar years before the year in which you make your request. For example, your request made in 2021 must relate to interest that accrued in 2011 or later.</p>
<p>To make a request fill out <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc4288.html">Form RC4288, Request for Taxpayer Relief – Cancel or Waive Penalties or Interest</a>.</p>
