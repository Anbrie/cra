<h2 id="h_1">T4A slips for 2020 tax year </h2>
<p>If you received COVID-19 emergency or recovery benefits from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), you will get a T4A slip for the amounts you received. </p>
<p>These benefit amounts are taxable. Any payments you received before December 31, 2020 need to be reported on your 2020 income tax and benefit return.</p>
<p>You will get a T4A slip if you received:</p>

<ul>
<li>Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) with the CRA </li>
<li>Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) </li>
<li>Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) </li>
<li>Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) </li>
<li>Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB) </li>
<li>Provincial or territorial COVID-19 financial assistance payments </li>
</ul>
<p>You will receive one T4A slip which includes all your COVID-19 benefit payments from the CRA. </p>
	
<p>The CRA will send your T4A slip before March 10, 2021. You may also get a copy of your T4A slip from CRA <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>. 
After March 10, 2021, if you still do not have your T4A information, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information.html">contact the CRA</a>.</p>
	
<p>Provincial or territorial COVID-19 financial assistance payments will be received on separate T4A slips.</p>
	
<h3 id="h_1_1">Other tax slips you may receive </h3>
	<p>You may get other tax slips in addition to the T4A slip.  </p>
	<dl class="dl-horizontal">

<dt>Amended T4A</dt>
<dd><p>If the CRA adjusts your T4A amounts, you may receive an amended T4A slip. Use the amended T4A slip to report your benefit amounts on your tax return.</p>

	<p>If you already filed your tax return with your original T4A slip, you must wait until it is assessed before you can <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/change-your-return.html">change your tax return</a>.</p></dd>

<p>If your employer received the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) to cover part of your wages, it be will be included as regular employment income on your <a href="t4e.html">T4 slip</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h_2">Verify COVID-19 amounts on your T4A slip </h2>

	<p>All CRA-administered COVID-19 benefits will be included on one T4A slip.</p>
	
		
<p>Each benefit will have its own box number (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/understand-your-tax-slips/t4-slips/t4a-statement-pension-retirement-annuity-other-income.html#cvd">Box 197 to 204</a>) on your T4A slip.

<p>To confirm the COVID-19 benefit payment amounts received, you can review "COVID-19 Support Payment Application Details" in CRA <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>. </p>

<h3 id="h_2_1">If you repaid a benefit or paid a tax instalment </h3>
<p>If you repaid a CRA COVID-19 benefit in 2020 or paid a T1 tax instalment, your payment may have been deposited to one of your other CRA accounts. Be sure to review all letters and notices you receive from the CRA, including payment summaries, tax slips, and other documents. Confirm the information and amounts are correct. </p>
<p>If any amounts are incorrect, they can be corrected by calling the CRA. Follow the instructions under <a href="#h_3">Issues with your T4A slip</a>. </p>

	
	<p>If you repaid benefit amounts:</p>
	<ul>
<li><strong>before December 31, 2020 </strong> - repayments should be reflected on your 2020 T4A slip (you won’t pay tax on repaid amounts on your 2020 taxes)</li>
<li><strong>after December 31, 2020 </strong> - you will be taxed on the full amount shown on your 2020 T4A slip (repayments will be reported on your 2021 T4A slip and claimed on next year's tax return)</li>
