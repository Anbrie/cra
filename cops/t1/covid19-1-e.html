<h2 id="h_1">T4A slips for 2020 tax year </h2>
<p>If you received COVID-19 emergency or recovery benefits from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), you should get a T4A slip for the amounts you received. </p>
<p>These benefit amounts are taxable income. Any payments you received before December 31, 2020 needs to be reported on your 2020 income tax and benefit return.</p>
<p>You will get a T4A slip if you received:</p>

<ul>
<li>Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) with the CRA </li>
<li>Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) </li>
<li>Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) </li>
<li>Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) </li>
<li>Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB) </li>
<li>Provincial or territorial COVID-19 financial assistance payments </li>
</ul>
<p>You will receive one T4A slip which includes all your COVID-19 benefit payments from the CRA and any provincial or territorial government payments.</p>
<p>The CRA will send your T4A slip starting in January 2021 and you should receive it before March 10, 2021. You may also get a copy of your T4A slip from CRA <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>. </p>
<p>After March 10, 2021, if you still do not have your T4A information, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information.html">contact the CRA</a>.</p>

<h3>Other tax slips you may receive </h3>
<p>You may also receive a <a href="http://test.canada.ca/cra/cops/t1/covid19-2-e.html">T4E slip</a> if you received CERB from Service Canada.</p>
<p>Quebec residents will get both a T4A slip and a <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/online-services/forms-and-publications/current-details/rl-1-t">RL-1 slip</a>.</p>
<p>If your employer received the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) to cover part of your wages, the income you earned will appear on your regular <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/understand-your-tax-slips/t4-slips/t4-statement-remuneration-paid.html">T4 slip</a>. </p>


<h2 id="h_2">Verify COVID-19 amounts on your T4A slip </h2>
<p>All COVID-19 benefits you received from the CRA and any provincial or territorial payments received in 2020 will be shown on one T4A slip.</p>
<p>Each benefit will have its own box number (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/understand-your-tax-slips/t4-slips/t4a-statement-pension-retirement-annuity-other-income.html#cvd">Box 197 to 204</a>) on your T4A slip. If you received more than one benefit with the CRA, check each benefit amount to make sure they are correct. You need to verify that any repayments you made before December 31, 2020 are accounted for on your T4A slip. </p>
<p>You can review your COVID-19 benefit payment amounts by selecting "COVID-19 Support Payment Application Details" in your CRA <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>. </p>

<h3 id="h_3_1">If you repaid CERB amounts </h3>
<p>If you repaid CERB amounts after December 31, 2020, you need to pay tax on the full amount shown on your T4A slip. The CRA will adjust the repaid amounts on your 2021 tax return. </p>

<h3 id="h_3_2">Find out if you need to repay CRB </h3>
<p>If you received the CRB and your net income is <strong>more than $38,000 </strong>(excluding CRB amounts), you may have to repay part or all of the benefit you received. </p>
<p>Any repayments owed will be included as part of your total balance owing for your 2020 taxes. </p>

<h4>Filing a paper return </h4>
<p>If line 23400 is <strong>more than $38,000</strong>, use the chart for line 23500 on the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-d1.html">worksheet for the return</a> to calculate your social benefits repayment amount you need to repay. </p>
