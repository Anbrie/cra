<h2 id="h_1">T4A slips for 2020 tax year </h2>
<p>If you received COVID-19 emergency or recovery benefits from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), you should get a T4A slip for the amounts you received. </p>
<p>These benefit amounts are taxable income. Any payments you received before December 31, 2020 needs to be reported on your 2020 income tax and benefit return.</p>
<p>You will get a T4A slip if you received:</p>

<ul>
<li>Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) with the CRA </li>
<li>Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) </li>
<li>Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) </li>
<li>Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) </li>
<li>Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB) </li>
<li>Provincial or territorial COVID-19 financial assistance payments </li>
</ul>
<p>You will receive one T4A slip which includes all your COVID-19 benefit payments from the CRA and any provincial or territorial government payments.</p>
<p>The CRA will send your T4A slip starting in January 2021 and you should receive it before March 10, 2021. You may also get a copy of your T4A slip from CRA <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>. </p>
<p>After March 10, 2021, if you still do not have your T4A information, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information.html">contact the CRA</a>.</p>
<h3 id="h_1_1">Other tax slips you may receive </h3>
<p>If you received CERB from Service Canada, you may also receive a <a href="http://test.canada.ca/cra/cops/t1/covid19-2-e.html">T4E slip</a>. </p>
<p>Quebec residents will get both a T4A slip and a <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/online-services/forms-and-publications/current-details/rl-1-t">RL-1 slip</a>.</p>
<p>If the CRA makes an adjustment to amounts on your T4A slip, you will receive an amended T4A slip. Use the <strong>amended T4A slip </strong>to report your benefit payment amounts on your tax return.</p>
<p>If the CRA verifies that you received a T4A slip for COVID-19 benefit payments in error, you will receive a <strong>cancelled T4A slip</strong>. You <strong>do not need to report </strong>the cancelled T4A amounts on your tax return.</p>
<p>If your employer received the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) to cover part of your wages, the income you earned will appear on your regular <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/understand-your-tax-slips/t4-slips/t4-statement-remuneration-paid.html">T4 slip</a>. </p>

<h2 id="h_2">Verify COVID-19 amounts on your T4A slip </h2>
<p>All COVID-19 benefits you received from the CRA and any provincial or territorial payments received in 2020 will be shown on one T4A slip.</p>
<p>Each benefit will have its own box number (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/understand-your-tax-slips/t4-slips/t4a-statement-pension-retirement-annuity-other-income.html#cvd">Box 197 to 204</a>) on your T4A slip. If you received more than one benefit with the CRA or made repayments, verify your benefit amounts on your T4A slip are correct before you report them on your tax return. </p>
<p>To help verify your amounts, review your COVID-19 benefit payment amounts by selecting "COVID-19 Support Payment Application Details" in your CRA <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>. </p>

<h3 id="h_2_1">If you repaid a benefit or paid a tax instalment </h3>
<p>If you repaid a CRA COVID-19 benefit in 2020 or paid a T1 tax instalment, your payment may have been deposited to another of your CRA accounts. Be sure to review all notices from the CRA, including payment summaries, your T4A, and T4E, to confirm that the amounts are correct. </p>
<p>If any amounts are incorrect, they can be easily corrected by calling the CRA. Follow the instructions under <strong>Issues with you T4A slip</strong>. </p>
<p>If you repaid a COVID-19 benefit payment <strong>in 2021</strong>, the repaid amounts will appear on your next year's T4A slip. The repayments will have be applied to your 2021 taxes. </p>

<p>In the space to the left of line 13000, specify the type of income you are reporting. If you are filing a paper return and received more than one benefit, attach a list of all benefits received. </p>

<h3 id="h_5_1">Report income tax deducted at source</h3>
<p>If you received the CRB, CRCB or CRSB, the CRA withheld a 10% tax at source on each payment.

<p>Quebec residents will get both a T4A and RL-1 slip. The 10% tax withheld at source will be split between the 2 tax slips, 5% will be reported on the T4A slip and the other 5% will be reported on the RL-1 slip. </p>

<h3 id="h_5_2">CRB repayments for net income above $38,000 </h3>
<p>If you received the CRB and your net income is <strong>more than $38,000 </strong>(excluding CRB amounts), you may have to repay part or all of the benefit you received. </p>
<p>Any repayments owed will be included as part of your total balance owing for your 2020 taxes. </p>

<h4 id="h_6">Complete the worksheet for the return for a paper filing</h4>
<p>If line 23400 is <strong>more than $38,000</strong>, use the chart for line 23500 on the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-d1.html">worksheet for the return</a> to calculate your social benefits repayment amount.
