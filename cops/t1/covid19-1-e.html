</ul>


<h2 id="h_1">Why you may receive tax slips</h2>
<p>If you received COVID-19 emergency or recovery benefits before December 31, 2020, you should get a tax slip with the amounts you received. These benefit amounts are taxable and need to be reported as income on your 2020 income and benefit return.</p>
<p>You will get a tax slip if you received:</p>

<ul>
<li>Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) </li>
<li>Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) </li>
<li>Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) </li>
<li>Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) </li>
<li>Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB) </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_2">Types of tax slips you may receive </h2>
<p>You will get a T4A slip, a T4E slip, or both, with the COVID-19 benefit amounts you received. This depends if you received your benefit payments from the Canada Revenue Agency or Service Canada.</p>
<p>If your employer received the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) to cover part of your wages, the income you earned will appear on your regular <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/understand-your-tax-slips/t4-slips/t4-statement-remuneration-paid.html">T4 slip</a>. </p>

<h3>Benefits from CRA will get a T4A slip </h3>
<p>If you received COVID-19 benefit payments in 2020 from the CRA, you will get a T4A slip starting in January 2021. You should receive your T4A slip before March 10, 2021. </p>
<p>Quebec residents will also get a <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/online-services/forms-and-publications/current-details/rl-1-t">RL-1 slip</a>.</p>
<p>You may also get your T4A slip from <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">CRA My Account</a>. </p>
<p>After March 10, 2021, if you still do not have your T4A slip information, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information.html">contact the CRA</a>.</p>
<p>Use the amounts from your T4A slip to <a href="http://test.canada.ca/cra/cops/t1/covid19-2-e.html">report your COVID-19 benefits on your tax return</a>.</p>

<h3>Benefits from Service Canada will get a T4E slip </h3>
<p>If you applied for the CERB with Service Canada or any Employment Insurance (EI) benefit payments, you will receive a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/understand-your-tax-slips/t4-slips/t4e-statement-employment-insurance-other-benefits.html">T4E slip</a> before mid-March 2021.</p>
<p>Quebec residents will also get a T4E(Q) slip.</p>
<p>You may also get your T4E information from <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account.html">My Service Canada Account</a>. </p>
<p>If you do not have your T4E slip, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/ei/ei-list/tax-slips-itemized.html#h2-13">contact Service Canada</a>.</p>
<p>Use the amounts from on your T4E slip to <a href="http://test.canada.ca/cra/cops/t1/covid19-2-e.html">report your COVID-19 benefits on your tax return</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h_3">Issues with your tax slips </h2>
<p>When you receive your tax slip, verify the COVID-19 amounts you received and any repayments you made before December 31, 2020 are accurate. </p>

<h3 id="h_3_1">Issues with your T4A slip </h3>
	<p>You will receive one T4A slip that includes <strong>all</strong> COVID-19 benefits you received from the CRA in 2020. Each benefit will have its own box number (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/understand-your-tax-slips/t4-slips/t4a-statement-pension-retirement-annuity-other-income.html#cvd">Box 197 to 204</a>) on your T4A slip. If you received more than one benefit with the CRA, check each benefit amount to make sure they are correct.</p>
<p>To confirm the COVID-19 benefit amounts you received, you can review "COVID-19 Support Payment Application Details" in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">CRA My Account</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Call the CRA right away if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your T4A slip shows incorrect amounts</li>
<li>You repaid benefit amounts before December 31, 2020, but the repayments are  not reflected</li>
<li>Your T4A slip shows incorrect personal information</li>

<h3 id="h_3_2">Issues with your T4E slip </h3>
<p>CERB benefit amounts received from Service Canada are included in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/understand-your-tax-slips/t4-slips/t4e-statement-employment-insurance-other-benefits.html">box 14</a> of your T4E slip. Your CERB benefit amount is not the only amount in box 14.</p>
<p>To calculate your CERB benefit amount, you need to subtract any other amounts you received from your total in box 14. This includes subtracting amounts from box 18, if you are not eligible for tax exempt benefits under the Indian Act.</p>
<p>If you received regular Employment Insurance (EI) benefits, those benefit amounts are not considered COVID-19 benefits. You will also need to subtract those amounts (from box 15) to calculate your CERB benefit amount. </p>
<p>To confirm your COVID-19 benefits amounts, you can get an itemized statement of your benefits from <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account.html">My Service Canada Account</a>.</p>
<p>If you have an issue with your T4E slip, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/ei/ei-list/tax-slips-itemized.html#h2-13">contact Service Canada</a>.</p>
