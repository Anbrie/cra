<h2 id="h_1">Why you may receive tax slips</h2>
<p>If you received COVID-19 emergency or recovery benefits before December 31, 2020, you should get a tax slip with the amounts you received. These benefit amounts are taxable and need to be reported as income on your 2020 income and benefit return.</p>
<p>You will get a tax slip if you received:</p>

<ul>
<li>Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) with the CRA</li>
<li>Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) </li>
<li>Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) </li>
<li>Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) </li>
<li>Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB) </li>
	<li>Provincial or territorial COVID-19 financial assistance payments </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_2">Types of tax slips you may receive </h2>
<p>You will get a T4A slip, a T4E slip, or both, with the COVID-19 benefit amounts you received. This depends if you received your benefit payments from the Canada Revenue Agency or Service Canada.</p>
<p>If your employer received the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) to cover part of your wages, the income you earned will appear on your regular <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/understand-your-tax-slips/t4-slips/t4-statement-remuneration-paid.html">T4 slip</a>. </p>

<h3>Benefits from CRA will get a T4A slip </h3>
<p>If you received COVID-19 benefit payments in 2020 from the CRA or your provincial or territorial government, you will get a T4A slip starting in January 2021. You should receive your T4A slip before March 10, 2021. </p>
<p>Quebec residents will also get a <a href="https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/online-services/forms-and-publications/current-details/rl-1-t">RL-1 slip</a>.</p>
<p>You may also get your T4A slip from <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">CRA My Account</a>. </p>
<p>After March 10, 2021, if you still do not have your T4A slip information, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information.html">contact the CRA</a>.</p>
<p>Use the amounts from your T4A slip to <a href="http://test.canada.ca/cra/cops/t1/covid19-2-e.html">report your COVID-19 benefits on your tax return</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h_3">Verify amounts on your tax slips </h2>
<p>When you receive your tax slip, verify the COVID-19 amounts you received and any repayments you made before December 31, 2020 are accurate. </p>

<h3 id="h_3_1">Issues with your T4A slip </h3>
	<p>You will receive one T4A slip that includes <strong>all</strong> COVID-19 benefits you received from the CRA in 2020. Each benefit will have its own box number (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/understand-your-tax-slips/t4-slips/t4a-statement-pension-retirement-annuity-other-income.html#cvd">Box 197 to 204</a>) on your T4A slip. If you received more than one benefit with the CRA, check each benefit amount to make sure they are correct.</p>
<p>To confirm the COVID-19 benefit amounts you received, you can review "COVID-19 Support Payment Application Details" in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">CRA My Account</a>. </p>

<p>Add up each COVID-19 benefit amount you received from your T4A slip and enter the total amount on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-13000-other-income.html">line 13000</a> of your 2020 income tax and benefit return. </p>
<p>In the space to the left of line 13000, specify the type of income you are reporting. If you are filing by paper and received more than one benefit, attach a list of all benefits in a note. </p>

<h4>Report income tax deducted from recovery benefits</h4>

<p>If you received the CRB, CRCB or CRSB, the CRA withheld a 10% tax at source on each payment. In addition to reporting the amounts on line 13000, enter the income tax deducted from <strong>box 022 </strong>on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-43700-total-income-tax-deducted.html">line 43700</a> on your 2020 tax return.</p>

<h4>If your income is tax exempt</h4>

<p>If your income is eligible for tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act, go to  <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/aboriginal-peoples.html">taxes and benefits for Indigenous peoples</a> for more Information.</p>

<h4>If you repaid CERB amounts</h4>

<p>If you repaid CERB amounts after December 31, 2020, you need to pay tax on the full amount shown on your T4A slip. The CRA will adjust the repaid amounts on your 2021 tax return. </p>

<h3 id="h_2_2">Find out if you need to repay CRB</h3>

<p>If you received the CRB and your net income is <strong>more than $38,000 </strong>(excluding CRB amounts), you may have to repay part or all of the benefit. </p>
<p>If you are filing by paper and your amount on line 23400 is more than $38,000, use the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-d1.html">worksheet for the return</a> to calculate the social benefits repayment amount. This tells you how much you need to repay. You will have to reimburse $0.50 of the CRB for every dollar of net income you earned above $38,000.</p>    <div class="row">

<p>You must enter the calculated amount from the worksheet on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-23500-social-benefits-repayment.html">line 23500</a> and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-42200-social-benefits-repayment.html">line 42200</a> of your tax return. You <strong>do not </strong>have to attach the completed worksheet to your return, but keep it for your records. </p>
<p>If you are filing electronically with certified tax software, the amounts you need to repay should be calculated for you and added to your balance owing.</p>
<p>If you have to repay part or all of your CRB, the repayments will be added to your total balance owing for your 2020 taxes. The same interest and penalties apply as any amounts you owe in taxes. </p>
