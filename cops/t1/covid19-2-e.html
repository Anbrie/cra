<li><strong>T4A slip: </strong>benefits received from the CRA </li>
<li><strong>T4E slip: </strong>Employment Insurance (EI) or CERB payments from Service Canada </li>

<p>If you are not eligible for the CERB and repaid amounts after December 31, 2020, the amounts will still show on your T4A slip. You need to report the full amounts on your 2020 tax return and may need to pay tax on those amounts. The repaid amounts will be adjusted on your 2021 tax return. </p>
	<p>Find out what you need to do, if you have an <a href="/cra/cops/t1/covid19-1-e.html#h_3_1">issue with your T4A slip</a>.</p>


<h3 id="h_2_1">Report T4A amounts<h3>
</h3>

<p>Add up each COVID-19 benefit amount you received from your T4A slip and enter the total amount on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-13000-other-income.html">line 13000</a> of your 2020 income tax and benefit return. </p>
<p>In the space to the left of line 13000, specify the type of income you are reporting. If you are filing by paper and received more than one benefit, attach a list of all benefits in a note. </p>

<h4>Report income tax deducted from recovery benefits<h4>
</h4>

<p>If you received the CRB, CRCB or CRSB, the CRA withheld a 10% tax at source on each payment. In addition to reporting the amounts on line 13000, enter the income tax deducted from <strong>box 022 </strong>on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-43700-total-income-tax-deducted.html">line 43700</a> on your 2020 tax return.</p>

<h4>If your income is tax exempt<h4>
</h4>

<p>If your income is eligible for tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act, the exempt income amount will be shown in <strong>box 144 </strong>of your T4A slip and does not need to be reported. For more details, go to: [Indigenous taxes]</p>

<h4>If you repaid CERB amounts<h4>
</h4>

<p>If you repaid CERB amounts after December 31, 2020, you need to pay tax on the full amount shown on your T4A slip. The CRA will adjust the repaid amounts on your 2021 tax return. </p>

<h3 id="h_2_2">Find out if you need to repay CRB<h3>
</h3>

<p>If you received the CRB and your net income is <strong>more than $38,000 </strong>(excluding CRB amounts), you may have to repay all or part of the benefit. </p>
<p>If you are filing by paper and your amount on line 23400 is more than $38,000, use the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-d1.html">worksheet for the return</a> to calculate the social benefits repayment amount. This tells you how much you need to repay. You will have to reimburse $0.50 of the CRB for every dollar of net income you earned above $38,000.</p>    <div class="row">

<li>Subtract your CRB amount from line 24 and enter the difference on line 26 </li>
<li>Subtract $38,000 (the base amount) from line 26 </li>
<li>Take the subtracted amount and multiply by 50% </li>
<li>Use the CRB amount or the 50% calculation (whichever is less) to calculate the amount for line 23500 </li>
<li>Enter this amount on both <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-23500-social-benefits-repayment.html">line 23500</a> and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-42200-social-benefits-repayment.html">line 42200</a> of your tax return </li>

<p>If you have to repay all or part of your CRB, the repayment amounts will be added to your total balance owing for your 2020 taxes. The same interest and penalties apply as any other amount you owe in taxes. The payment deadline is April 30, 2021 for the 2020 tax year. </p>
<p>You <strong>do not </strong>have to attach the completed worksheet to your return, but keep it for your records. </p>
<h2 id="h_3">If you received a T4E slip </h2>  
<p>If you received your CERB benefit payments from Service Canada, your benefit amount will be included in <strong>box 14 </strong>of your T4E slip. </p>
<p>Your CERB benefit amount is not the only amount in box 14. It also includes regular employment insurance benefits and other benefits paid.</p>
