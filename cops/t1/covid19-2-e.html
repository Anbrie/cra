<h2 id="h_1">T4E slips for 2020 tax year
</h2>
<p>If you received Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) with Service Canada or any Employment Insurance (EI) benefit payments, you should get a T4E tax slip with the amounts you received. </p>
<p>These benefit amounts are taxable income. Any payments you received before December 31, 2020 will need to be reported on your 2020 tax return.</p>
<p>You will receive a T4E slip before mid-March 2021 or you may also get your T4E information from <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account.html">My Service Canada Account</a>. </p>

<h2 id="h_2">Verify CERB amounts on your T4E slip
</h2>
<p>When you receive your T4E slip, make sure the CERB amounts you received are correct. You also need to verify any repayments you made before December 31, 2020 are accounted for. </p>
<p>CERB benefit payment amounts received from Service Canada are included in <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/understand-your-tax-slips/t4-slips/t4e-statement-employment-insurance-other-benefits.html">box 14</a> of your T4E slip. Your CERB benefit amount is not the only amount in box 14.</p>
<p>You can review your CERB benefit payment amounts in an itemized statement of your benefits from <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account.html">My Service Canada Account</a>. You can verify the amounts you received matches the dates you received them.</p>

<h3>Report an issue with your T4E slip
