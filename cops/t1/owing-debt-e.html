<p>If this is your first time with a tax debt or if you are unsure of what do next, the CRA can work with you to find the best way to resolve your debt.</p>
<h2 class="h3">On this page</h2>
<ul>

<li><a href="#h_5">Do you owe a balance</a></li>
		<li><a href="#h_1">Pay your amount owing</a></li>
	<li><a href="#h_2">You cannot pay in full</a></li>
	
<li><a href="#h_3">COVID-19 benefit payments</a></li>
	<li><a href="#h_4">Interest relief on 2020 taxes owing due to COVID-19</a></li>


</ul>
<h2 id="h_5">Do you owe a balance</h2>
	
	<p>If your total payable (line 43500 of your return) is more than your total credits (line 48200 of your return), enter the difference on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-48500-balance-owing.html">line 48500</a>. This amount is your balance owing. </p>
	<p>Your balance owing is due no later than <strong>April 30, 2021</strong>.</p> 

	 
	
<h2 id="h_1">Pay your amount owing </h2>
<p>If you are able to pay your amount owing in full, you have several options to pay your taxes or other debts. These include online, in person, or using a third-party service provider.</p>
			 
			  <p>Find a payment option that works for you: </p>

			  
			  <p><a class="btn btn-call-to-action ip-btn" href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/make-a-payment-canada-revenue-agency/make-payment.html">Make a payment</a></p>	
			  
<h2 id="h_2">You cannot pay in full</h2>
			  
			  <p>If you are not able to pay the full amount before the deadline:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can avoid paying a late-filing penalty, if you file your return on time</li>
<li>you can make a partial payment to reduce the amount of interest you need to pay on unpaid amounts</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the following tools to help you determine what you can afford to pay on a regular basis: </p>

			  
			  <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/when-you-money-collections-cra/worksheet-disclaimer.html">Income and expense worksheet</a> </li>
				  <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/when-you-money-collections-cra/calculator-disclaimer.html">Payment arrangement calculator</a></li>
				  
               
                  </ul>
			  <p>The CRA has expanded payment arrangement options to give Canadians more time and flexibility to repay what they owe based on their ability to pay: </p>
			  
			  <ul>
<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/when-you-money-collections-cra/personal-debt.html">Make a payment arrangement</a></li>
</ul>
			  
            <p>For other options:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/when-you-money-collections-cra.html">When you owe money – collections at the CRA</a></li></ul>
			   
			   <h2 id="h_3">COVID-19 benefit payments </h2>
			  
<p>If you received emergency or recovery benefits, keep in mind these benefits are taxable. This means you will receive a tax slip for the amount of benefits you received, and may owe taxes this year. For more details, go to <a href="covid19-e.html">COVID-19 benefits and your taxes</a>.
</p>
<p>If you have repaid any benefits you were not entitled to before December 31, 2020, the CRA won't include that amount in the T4A tax slip.</p>
			  
			
			  
			<h2 id="h_4">Interest relief on 2020 taxes owing due to COVID-19</h2>
			   
			  <p>Interest relief will be given to people who have a total taxable income of $75,000 or less in 2020 and received at least one COVID-19 benefit in 2020. You must file your 2020 tax return to qualify for interest relief.</p>
  
<p>File your tax return before the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/important-dates-individuals/filing-dates-tax-return.html">due date</a>, as late-filing penalites still apply. If you file late, you will be charged a 5% late-filing penalty on top of what you already owe, plus an additional 1% for each month (up to a maximum of 12 months).</p>

			   <p>For details, go to <a href="interest-relief-e.html">interest relief due to COVID-19</a>.</p>
