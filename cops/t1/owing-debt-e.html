            <h2 id="h_1">Pay your amount owing </h2>
<p>If you are able to pay your amount owing in full, you have several options to pay your taxes including online, in person, or using a third-party service provider.</p>
			 
			  <p>Find a payment option that works for you: </p>

			  
			  <p><a class="btn btn-call-to-action ip-btn" href="/en/revenue-agency/services/make-a-payment-canada-revenue-agency/make-payment.html">Make a payment</a></p>
			  
			<h2 id="h_2">You cannot pay in full</h2>
			  
			  <p>If you are not able to pay the full amount before the deadline:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can avoid paying a late-filing penalty, if you file your return on time</li>
<li>you can make a partial payment to reduce the amount of interest you need to pay on unpaid amounts</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the following tools to help you determine what you can afford to pay on a regular basis: </p>

			  
			  <ul>
                    <li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/when-you-money-collections-cra/worksheet-disclaimer.html">Income and expense worksheet</a> </li>
				  <li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/when-you-money-collections-cra/calculator-disclaimer.html">Payment arrangement calculator</a></li>
				  
               
                  </ul>
			  <p>The CRA has expanded payment arrangement options to give Canadians more time and flexibility to repay what they owe based on their ability to pay: </p>
			  
			  <ul>
<li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/when-you-money-collections-cra/personal-debt.html">Make a payment arrangement</a></li>
</ul>
			  
            <p>For other options:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/when-you-money-collections-cra.html">When you owe money – collections at the CRA</a></li></ul>
			  
			<h2 id="h_3">Interest relief due to COVID-19</h2>
<p>Interest relief will be given to Canadians who had a total taxable income of $75,000 or less in 2020 <strong>and</strong> received at least one of these COVID-19-related income support benefits in 2020:</p>
 
<ul>
<li>Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) </li>
<li>Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) </li>
<li>Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) </li>
<li>Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) </li>
<li>Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB) </li>
<li>Employment Insurance benefits </li>
<li>Provincial emergency benefits
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If you meet the criteria and have filed your 2020 tax return, the CRA will automatically apply interest relief on your 2020 taxes owing. You will not have to pay interest on any amount owing from your 2020 taxes until April 30, 2022.  </p>
 
<p>This does not apply to late-filing penalties, so make sure you file your tax return before the due date.  If you file late, you will be charged a 5% late-filing penalty on top of what you already owe, plus an additional 1% for each month (up to a maximum of 12 months). </p>
			  <p>Interest will start after April 30, 2022 on any amount owing for the 2020 tax year.</p>
 
<!--<p>Option 2: Make sure you file your taxes on time as this does not include the late filing penalty. If you file late you will get a 5% late-filing penalty that will be applied to your balance owing, plus an additional 1% for each month (up to a maximum of 12 months). </p>-->
			  
<h2 id="h_4">COVID-19 benefit payments </h2>
			  
<p>If you received emergency or recovery benefits, keep in mind these benefits are taxable. This means you will receive a <a href="/en/revenue-agency/campaigns/covid-19-update/covid-19-t4a.html">T4A tax slip for the amount of benefits you received</a>, and may owe taxes this year. </p>
<p>If you have repaid any benefits you were not entitled to before December 31, 2020, the CRA won't include that amount in the T4A tax slip.</p>
