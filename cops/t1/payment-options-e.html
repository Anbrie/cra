	    <p>The CRA understands that individuals might be dealing with difficulties in meeting their financial obligations, including paying tax debts they may have incurred prior to or during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p> If you cannot pay an existing debt in full, you may be eligible to <a href="#entering">enter into a payment arrangement</a>. Payment arrangement options are being expanded to reflect current realities resulting from COVID-19 and give Canadians more time and flexibility to repay based on their ability to pay.
</p>
        <h2 id="partial">Making a partial payment towards your debt</h2>
        
          <p>Making a <strong>partial payment</strong> to the CRA still requires you to <a href="#entering">enter into a payment arrangement</a>.</p>
       
        <h2 id="entering">Entering into a payment arrangement</h2>
        <p>Before you make a payment arrangement, you may need to show that you have tried to pay your debt in full by borrowing money or reducing your expenses. To figure out your ability to pay, we may ask you to provide proof of your income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. You may have to do this by telephone or by completing a financial questionnaire.</p>

   <h3>Determine how much you can pay</h3>
   
        <p>Before you determine the amount and the frequency to be paid, the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/when-you-money-collections-cra/worksheet-disclaimer.html">Personal income and expense worksheet</a> is a helpful budget tool to help you determine what you can afford to pay on a regular basis.</p>

   <h3>Propose a payment amount</h3>
   
		
        <p>Use the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/when-you-money-collections-cra/calculator-disclaimer.html">Payment Arrangement Calculator</a> to calculate the payment amounts based on amount you want to pay, or the frequency on when you want to pay down your debt. The calculator also includes the prescribed CRA interest rates.</p>

   <h3> Set up your payment arrangement</h3>

   <h3>Start to make your payments</h3>
        <p>In order to keep your payment arrangement, you will need to make a payment on the agreed upon dates. There are many ways to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/make-a-payment-canada-revenue-agency/make-payment/general-payment.html">make a payment</a>.</p>
        <p>You must pay as agreed, continue to file all returns on time, and stay up to date with your tax obligations. Payment arrangements may be subject to periodic reviews.</p>
        <p>Even if you have a payment arrangement and are making payments, the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> is <strong>authorized to take amounts from any benefits or credits you receive</strong> when you have a debt.</p>

        <h2 id="changes">Changing your payment arrangement</h2>
        <p>If your situation changes and you need to adjust the payment plan, or you are <a href="paying-unable-e.html">no longer able to pay</a>, you must contact the CRA.</p>
        <div class="alert alert-warning provisional">
          <p>If you do not take action to fix your situation, the CRA may proceed with <strong>legal actions</strong> to collect the balance of your debt. </p>
